<h2>CHAPTER I<br />

<small>THE GLORY ROAD TO FRANCE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;You, over there in the crowd, and <em>you</em>
and <em>you</em>, why don&#8217;t you get busy and
help Uncle Sam? What are you hanging
back for? Now&#8217;s your chance to show that
you&#8217;re a real American, and ready to fight for your
country. What&#8217;s the use of waiting for the
draft to get you? You&#8217;re just wasting time!
The sooner you enlist, the sooner you&#8217;ll be
ready to do your bit in France. It&#8217;s up to good
old Uncle Sam to jump into the big war and
win it. But he can&#8217;t do it alone. It needs a
lot of brave, husky fellows to lick the Boches
off the map. Are you going to be one of &#8217;em?
Every little bit helps, you know!</p>

<p>&#8220;Now we&#8217;re going to sing you one more song.
While we&#8217;re singing it, get on the job and think
hard. We want to take a bunch of you back with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
us to the recruiting station. All right, boys.
Give &#8217;em &#8216;The Glory Road to France!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Standing in the middle of a big recruiting
wagon, lavishly decorated in red, white and blue,
the orator, a good-looking young soldier of perhaps
twenty years, bawled out, &#8220;Let &#8217;er go!&#8221;</p>

<p>From one end of the wagon rose the strains
of a lively air, enthusiastically hammered out
on a small, portable piano by another khaki-clad
youngster, seated on a stool before it.
Gathered about him, half a dozen clean-cut soldier
boys immediately took it up. The sheer
catchiness of the melody, tunefully shouted out
by the singers, had its effect on the crowd. The
sturdy quality of the words, too, brought a flash
of newly aroused patriotism to more than one
pair of eyes belonging to the throng of persons
closely packed about the big wagon. It appeared
to deepen with the lustily given chorus:</p>


<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse">&#8220;Take the Glory Road for France,</div>
    <div class="verse i2">Hike along to join the fray,</div>
    <div class="verse">With the Sammies take a chance</div>
    <div class="verse i2">&#8217;Neath the Stars and Stripes to-day.</div>
    <div class="verse">At the front brave men are falling,</div>
    <div class="verse i2">Now&#8217;s your time to do and dare.</div>
    <div class="verse">Don&#8217;t you hear your Uncle calling,</div>
    <div class="verse i2">&#8216;Boys, I need you &#8220;Over There&#8221;!&#8217;&#8221;</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>At the extreme edge of the crowd, a gaily
painted roadster had come to a full stop, its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
progress temporarily checked by the mass of
persons about the wagon. It was a four-cylinder
car, built low, with one gasoline tank behind
the seat and still another behind it, a small
reserve. The body of the roadster, painted a
bright green, stood out sharply by reason of
the red wire wheels. The doorless entrance at
one side formed a neat &#8220;U,&#8221; while the extra
tires, also mounted on red wire wheels, strapped
on at the rear, gave it a last additional touch.
Plainly it was built for speed and had a mischievous,
runaway air about it that accorded
curiously with its driver, a gray-eyed, sunny-haired
young man of perhaps eighteen, whose
clean-cut features bore an expression of reckless
good humor that immediately stamped him
as one of those wide-awake, restless lads in
whom the love of mischief is ingrained.</p>

<p>Forced to slow down and halt his car by the
ever-waving arm of a traffic policeman, he now
leaned forward over the wheel, his attention
fixed on the singers. He had come upon the
scene at the moment when the youthful orator
had commenced his harangue. Further, he had
been one of those whom the latter had addressed
as &#8220;you.&#8221; From a good-humored grin,
his boyish mouth had gradually grown grave
as he listened. First sight of the recruiting
wagon had recalled to Jimmy Blaise a matter
which had been troubling him ever since the
United States had declared war against Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>many.
The only son of an intensely patriotic
father and mother, despite his love of fun
Jimmy had done some serious thinking about
the big war.</p>

<p>At the last ringing line of appeal, &#8220;Boys, I
need you &#8216;Over There,&#8217;&#8221; involuntarily Jimmy
spoke his mind aloud. &#8220;I guess that&#8217;s right,&#8221;
he agreed, with a vigorous wag of his head.</p>

<p>A boy standing close to the roadster caught
the remark and glanced levelly at the speaker.
In his dark blue eyes there was an answering
flash which the other lad caught and read
aright. For an instant the two stared at each
other in silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;How about it?&#8221; demanded Jimmy genially.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess Uncle Sam needs us all right
enough,&#8221; the blue-eyed boy replied, his sober
face lighting into a singularly sunny smile.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve thought a lot about it. I&#8217;d like to go.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Put her there!&#8221; The youth in the car
leaned down and shot out a friendly hand.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been thinking about it myself. I can go
to-morrow, that is, if I get accepted. I asked
my folks the other night what they&#8217;d do if I
enlisted. I&#8217;m not twenty-one, you see. Quite
a long way from it. Won&#8217;t be nineteen until
next November.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did they say?&#8221; questioned the other
eagerly.</p>

<p>&#8220;They both said it was up to me. They&#8217;re
not slackers. I can just tell you that. Of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
course, my mother looked kind of sad for a minute;
then she braced up and said she&#8217;d be proud
to have a soldier son. My father said if he was
young enough he&#8217;d enlist himself. That shows
pretty plainly what sort of stuff they&#8217;re made
of.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say so,&#8221; emphasized the blue-eyed
boy. &#8220;I was nineteen last month. My father
and mother are both dead. I take care of myself.
So you see there isn&#8217;t anyone to
care&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, that&#8217;s tough,&#8221; sympathized
Jimmy. &#8220;Say, I like you. You&#8217;re all right.
What do you say? Let&#8217;s enlist. Yes? No ride
in that recruiting wagon for me, though. Look!
They&#8217;ve got four fellows already! That Glory
Road song waked &#8217;em up, <em>I</em> guess. Tell you
what you do. Jump into my roadster and we&#8217;ll
get away from here and be at the station ahead
of those fellows. This car can certainly go
some. I call it &#8216;Old Speedy.&#8217; If we were out
in the country on a good smooth road I&#8217;d give
you a fast ride, all right. Course I have to go
easy in the city. But climb in and let&#8217;s beat
it. Those Sammies in the wagon are getting
ready to move on. What&#8217;s the matter? You&#8217;re
not going to back out, are you?&#8221; Quick to note
a trace of hesitation in his new acquaintance&#8217;s
manner, the gray-eyed boy&#8217;s straight brows
drew together in a disappointed frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Back out? Well, I <em>guess</em> not.&#8221; With this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
the other boy hopped nimbly up to a seat beside
the driver. &#8220;It&#8217;s fine of you to do this,&#8221; he
burst forth impulsively. &#8220;Why, you don&#8217;t even
know my name or&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, can it,&#8221; grinned Jimmy. &#8220;I took a good
look at you. That&#8217;s enough. I always know
when I first see a fellow whether I&#8217;m going to
like him or not. I don&#8217;t change my mind about
him, either. Now I&#8217;m going to back out of here
in a hurry. I&#8217;ll turn around up the street, then
cut down a side street and hit it up for the recruiting
station.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this Jimmy busied himself with his car
and soon had it backed far enough to make the
turn. As it glided into the side street, his companion
glanced over one shoulder at the crowd
they had left behind. &#8220;It looks as if they were
going to start,&#8221; he commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em start. We&#8217;ll beat &#8217;em to it,&#8221; predicted
Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll run as fast as I dare.
Say,&#8221; he continued, as they spun along over
the smooth pavement, &#8220;as long as we enlist together,
we&#8217;ll probably be sent to the same training
camp. Then we&#8217;ll be pals. How&#8217;s that?
My name&#8217;s James Sumner Blaise. My folks
call me Jimmy and the fellows call me Jimmy
Blazes.&#8221;</p>

<p>His companion smiled at this funny nickname.
He was already under the spell of Jimmy&#8217;s careless,
happy-go-lucky manner.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to be pals,&#8221; came his hearty re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>sponse.
&#8220;My name&#8217;s Roger Barlow. I&#8217;ve been
working in a munitions plant ever since the war
in Europe began. I used to be in the shipping
room of a big hardware place. I didn&#8217;t make
very good wages, so I left it for munitions. This
is the first Saturday afternoon I&#8217;ve had off for
three months. I&#8217;ve earned quite a lot of money
and I&#8217;ve got almost a hundred dollars saved
up,&#8221; he added confidentially.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> haven&#8217;t a hundred cents,&#8221; confessed
Jimmy cheerfully. &#8220;My father gives me an allowance
on the first of every month. I&#8217;m always
broke before the tenth. I just came home from
Langley&mdash;that&#8217;s a prep school&mdash;in June. I&#8217;d be
in Harvard next fall if this hadn&#8217;t happened.
Maybe I will be anyhow. Hope not. I&#8217;d hate
to be turned down. I don&#8217;t believe I will be,
though. I&#8217;m pretty husky. I&#8217;ve never taken a
drink of anything stronger than ginger ale, and
I hardly ever smoke. I&#8217;ve never been sick,
either, since I had the measles. That was long
ago. I played quarterback on the football team
at Langley, and I hold the record there for the
hundred-yard dash.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My, you&#8217;ve done a lot of things, haven&#8217;t
you?&#8221; admired Roger. &#8220;I&#8217;ve always wanted to
play football, but never had a chance to learn
how. I&#8217;m good and strong, though. Hard
work&#8217;s made me so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When we get to camp, maybe we&#8217;ll meet
some nice fellows that want to organize a foot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>ball
team. Then you&#8217;ll get a chance to play.
It&#8217;s a great old game, all right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would be fine,&#8221; glowed Roger.</p>

<p>The two lads whom Chance had so curiously
thrown together were beginning already to plan
as if their enlistment were an assured fact.
Judging from outward appearances, Uncle Sam
would be only too glad to number them among
the khaki-clad host of young patriots, so soon
to receive in a foreign land their baptism of fire
and steel. Of almost the same height, about
five feet ten inches, their clear eyes, healthfully
tinted cheeks and straight, spare boyish
figures showed the admirable result of clean
living.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here we are.&#8221; Jimmy had brought his
roadster to a full stop before a tall, rather dingy
brick building. The huge plate-glass front of
the ground floor was filled with large placards
of soldiers, resplendent in the becoming uniform
of the United States Army. Straight
across the top of it a white banner stretched
from one side to the other. It bore in large
black letters the pertinent legend, &#8220;Do Your
Bit for Your Country: Enlist NOW!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s us.&#8221; Jimmy leaped from his car
and nodded jovially at the sign. Roger landed
on the sidewalk only a second behind him.
&#8220;Forward march and mind your step, Roger,
old pal! We&#8217;re going to do our bit, all right,
if Uncle Sam&#8217;ll take us.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Side by side, their boyish faces illumined by
the light of patriotism, the two swung up the
short flight of steps, splendid examples of
sturdy, buoyant young American manhood.
Yes, there was little doubt that Uncle Sam would
take them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />

<small>OFF TO CAMP STERLING</small></h2>


<p>One o&#8217;clock of a sunshiny September
afternoon saw a company of young men
marching by twos down a long wooden
platform, on each side of which rose waiting
trains. Though still in civilian clothing, their
careers as soldiers had fairly begun. Through
the iron gates of the station streamed after
them another procession of a somewhat different
order. Though it numbered a few men, it
consisted chiefly of anxious-faced women both
young and elderly, who had come out that afternoon
to wish the newly enlisted soldiers Godspeed
before their start for Camp Sterling.</p>

<p>Well toward the end of the little double
line were Jimmy Blaise and Roger Barlow. A
little over a week had passed since that eventful
Saturday afternoon when the two boys had
driven to the recruiting station in Jimmy&#8217;s car.
Uncle Sam had indeed been willing to number
them among his daily growing host of young<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
patriots. They had passed through the ordeal
of a rigid examination with flying colors. Having
gone thus far in the process of enlistment,
they had since been impatiently waiting for the
summons that would call them to a training
camp, there to undergo a final test, take the oath
of allegiance and begin soldiering in earnest.
Both were distinctly elated at having thus easily
passed the first test. With one accord they had
decided on the infantry as the most desirable
branch of the service for them. Infantry promised
plenty of excitement.</p>

<p>Having already obtained the sanction of his
parents to enlist, it had but remained to light-hearted
Jimmy to go home and inform them that
the great deed was done. With Roger there had
been no one to consult, other than notifying the
employment office of the munitions plant of his
new move. This he proposed to do on the following
Monday morning. Rather reluctantly
he had given in to his friend&#8217;s persuasions that
he should accompany Jimmy to his home that
Saturday afternoon and meet the latter&#8217;s parents.
The Blaises lived in one of the most beautiful
suburbs of the great city, and the very
sight of the stately stone house which the lucky
Jimmy called home, set well back on a wide,
tree-dotted lawn, had filled Roger with secret
dismay. As the roadster had rolled up the
broad drive that wound its way through the
grounds to the garage, situated well behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
house, he had been stirred with a strong desire
to jump out of it and hurry away. He wondered
whether Jimmy&#8217;s folks would approve of him.</p>

<p>Later, when he had met the Blaises and found
them delightfully friendly and hospitable, he
had been glad that he had not yielded to his
first panicky impulse to flee. Thoroughly accustomed
to their son&#8217;s whirlwind tactics, Mr.
and Mrs. Blaise had not only accepted Jimmy&#8217;s
new friend at his face value, but had also privately
approved Roger&#8217;s quiet, resolute manner
and direct, courteous speech.</p>

<p>During the brief time that had elapsed between
the enlistment of the two lads until the
morning of farewell, he had been a frequent
guest of easy-going Jimmy. The prophesy of
friendship that the latter had made on the afternoon
of their first meeting had become an actual
fact.</p>

<p>Jimmy not only grew daily fonder of Roger
on account of his sturdy manliness. He also
respected the other boy for what he knew. Considering
the fact that Roger had left high school
to go to work at the close of his second year
there, what he had gained by both work and
study at night amounted to a good deal. On
the other hand, Roger had never before encountered
a boy quite so likable as Jimmy. Opposites
by nature, each hailed the other&#8217;s good
qualities with boyish enthusiasm. The very sincerity
of their liking for each other was to carry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
them triumphantly through many strenuous
days that lay ahead of them.</p>

<p>Now bound for Camp Sterling together, they
were two very excited and almost happy boys,
as in company with fifty other youths they
marched down the platform that afternoon,
there to say their last words of farewell to Mrs.
and Mr. Blaise before boarding the fateful train.
Of the two, Jimmy was scarcely more concerned
at saying good-bye to his parents than was
Roger at taking leave of these kind friends.
For a brief season he had once again known
something of the joy of a real home. It would
be very hard to say farewell to Jimmy&#8217;s parents,
he thought. They had taken the kindest
interest in him. Already Mrs. Blaise had more
than once smilingly called him her foster-son.
Looking gratefully back to the Saturday afternoon
of his first meeting with Jimmy, he had
wondered how it had all come about.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mother, over yonder, and Father,
too,&#8221; muttered Jimmy in Roger&#8217;s ear. Paused
beside the train that was to bear them away,
the company of prospective Khaki Boys had
begun seeking their own among the throng of
civilians for a last word. &#8220;I almost wish they
hadn&#8217;t come. It hurts to say good-bye. Anyway,
we&#8217;ll see them again before long, if we behave,&#8221;
he added with a faint grin. &#8220;No behavee,
no furloughs.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this he made his way to the waiting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
couple, who had already spied him, Roger at his
heels. Since his enlistment in the Regular Army
this was the one shadow that had clouded Jimmy&#8217;s
enthusiasm in his new patriotic venture.
He had resolutely shoved into the background
all thought of saying good-bye. Now that the
dread moment had come, he looked exceedingly
solemn.</p>

<p>&#8220;Good-bye, Roger.&#8221; Mrs. Blaise extended
her hand. Obeying a motherly impulse she bent
forward and kissed his cheek. &#8220;Be a good soldier
boy. I know you&#8217;ll be a good friend to
Jimmy.&#8221; Her blue eyes wandered affectionately
to her son, who was gravely shaking hands
with his father, his merry features grown momentarily
sad.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about me, Mother.&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s
voice sounded a trifle husky. &#8220;I can take
care of myself and Roger, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>Not ashamed to show his affection for his
mother in public, Jimmy wrapped his strong
young arms about her in a loving hug. &#8220;I&#8217;m
going to be a regular angel Sammy,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make you proud of me.
Maybe by the time I come home for Thanksgiving
I&#8217;ll be a general or something. I guess it&#8217;ll
be &#8216;or something,&#8217;&#8221; he added with a half-hearted
attempt at humor. &#8220;If I can get a pass
to come and see you before then, you know I&#8217;ll
do it. It&#8217;s only a few hours&#8217; ride in the train
from here to Camp Sterling. So cheer up, best<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
Mother. I&#8217;ll be back driving Old Speedy around
town again before you know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>For a little the two boys lingered there, then
with the sound of fond, final farewells in their
ears they climbed the steps of the rear car and
were lost for an instant to view. Almost immediately
a window on the side next the platform
went up and two heads emerged therefrom.
Far down the track the engine was
already sending forth premonitory warnings.
They were followed by the creaking jar of ponderous
iron wheels about to be set to their work
of separating the Khaki Boys from home.</p>

<p>By this time every window casing of the car
framed boyish faces, peering eagerly out for a
last exchange of looks and words with the home
folks. As the train began to show signs of moving,
a pretty girl, laden with a bouquet of long-stemmed
red roses, now flung it straight toward
a rear window of the car from which a soldier
boy leaned far out, his eyes fixed upon her. His
right arm shot out in a wild attempt to catch
it. It fell short of his extended fingers by a
bare inch or so and dropped. Quick as lightning
a uniformed figure on the lowest step of
the train&#8217;s rear platform sprang for it, fairly
snatching it up as it was about to roll under the
slowly revolving iron wheels. Pausing only to
raise his cap to the thrower, the officer who had
retrieved the flowers from destruction swung
aboard the train and disappeared into the car.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
The next second the soldier for whom the bouquet
had been intended was triumphantly waving
it out the window.</p>

<p>The hearty cheering which had begun with
the first shudder of the train increased to wild
applause of the little act of gallantry. Inside
the car the young volunteers were also voicing
noisy appreciation. It was merely an incident,
and yet it served to impress on those left behind
the belief that the welfare of their boys
was in good hands.</p>

<p>As the train continued to move slowly out
of the long shed the cheering was kept up. This
time it was for the Khaki Boys themselves. It
met with an equally fervent response on their
part, accompanied by a frantic waving of hands,
hats and handkerchiefs. The Khaki Boys were
started at last on the first stretch of the Glory
Road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />

<small>THE BEGINNING OF COMRADESHIP</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;Did you see the way that officer grabbed
those roses from under the wheels?&#8221;
demanded Jimmy excitedly, as he and
Roger settled back in their seats. The train
had now left the shed behind and was steadily
gathering momentum. &#8220;Pretty clever in him,
wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger nodded. &#8220;It showed that he was interested
in us even if we are just rookies. I
wonder how long it will take us to look as well
in our uniforms as he does in his? What did
you do with your Infantry Manual? We ought
to be studying up a little while we&#8217;re on the
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger referred to the little blue books he and
Jimmy had purchased at a department store
soon after their enlistment. As he spoke he
reached into a pocket of his coat and drew his
own forth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s kicking around in my suitcase some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>where,&#8221;
grinned Jimmy rather sheepishly.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been intending to study it, but I&#8217;ve had
so many other things to do. Put it back. Don&#8217;t
go to studying now. I want to talk to you.
Time enough for us to get busy when we hit
Camp Sterling. Maybe I didn&#8217;t hate to leave
Old Speedy behind, though. Next to the folks
comes Speedy and after that Buster, my brindle
bull pup. That dog certainly knew I was going
away for keeps when I said good-bye to him.
But he won&#8217;t be neglected. Buster has lots of
friends. Everybody on our street knows him.
Next to me he likes Mother. She&#8217;ll take good
care of him. But poor Old Speedy&#8217;ll have a
lonesome time shut up in the garage. It&#8217;s such
a giddy-looking machine you couldn&#8217;t hire the
folks to ride half a block in it. But you can&#8217;t
have everything, so what&#8217;s the use of worrying?&#8221;</p>

<p>His active mind leaping from the subject of
his car back to the officer whose recent kindly
act he had so sturdily commended, he continued
irrelevantly: &#8220;Say, an officer that would do a
thing like that ought to be good to his men.
Don&#8217;t you think so? I&#8217;ve heard a lot of stuff
about officers being regular cranks and jumping
all over their men just for spite. Do you
suppose it&#8217;s true?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t,&#8221; Roger made emphatic return.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe that part of it is much
different in the Army from what it is in a shop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
or factory or an office. Only, of course, there
has to be stricter discipline in the Army. I&#8217;ve
worked in a good many different places and
I&#8217;ve found out that the way you&#8217;re treated most
always depends on the way you do your work.
Of course, wherever you go you&#8217;re sure to meet
some people you won&#8217;t like and who won&#8217;t like
you. If you mind your own business and let
&#8217;em alone, generally they&#8217;ll let you alone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But suppose they don&#8217;t? What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; Roger looked reflective, &#8220;I never had
that happen to me but once. It was when I
worked in that shipping department. There
was a boy about my size or maybe a little bigger
who wouldn&#8217;t let me alone. He&#8217;d make mistakes
and then lay them to me. At last I got
sick of it and gave him a good licking. He let
me alone after that. You couldn&#8217;t do that with
an Army officer, though. You&#8217;d have to stand
it and say nothing. Anyway, I don&#8217;t believe
you&#8217;d find one officer in a thousand that
wouldn&#8217;t treat you fairly. It&#8217;s just as much to
them to have the respect of their men as it is
to the men to have the good will of their officers.&#8221;</p>

<p>Unconsciously Roger had voiced the opinion
that prevails from coast to coast among both
commissioned and non-commissioned officers in
the United States Service. The mistaken impression
that those who have been placed in
commands in the National Army are a brow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>beating,
bullying lot is fast passing. The Army
officer of to-day respects himself too much to
abuse his authority. He also values the good
will of his men too greatly to abuse them. All
this, however, the Khaki Boys were presently
to learn for themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess your head&#8217;s level,&#8221; conceded Jimmy.
&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you licked that shipping-room dub.
I hate a <em>sneak</em>!&#8221;</p>

<p>The explosive utterance caused the heads of
two young men in the seat in front of their own
to turn simultaneously in Jimmy&#8217;s direction.
One of them, a dark, thin-faced lad with twinkling
black eyes and a wide, pleasant mouth,
spoke. &#8220;Hope you didn&#8217;t mean me,&#8221; he offered
good-humoredly. The other, stockily-built, his
pale, stolid features bearing the unmistakable
cast of the foreigner, stared at Jimmy out of
round, china-blue eyes, with the unblinking gaze
of an owl.</p>

<p>&#8220;Course not,&#8221; apologized Jimmy, reddening.
&#8220;Why should I mean you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know, I&#8217;m sure.&#8221; The smiling lips
widened to a broad grin. &#8220;You said it pretty
loudly. It almost made me jump.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I meant it,&#8221; maintained Jimmy
stoutly, &#8220;but not for you. I meant it for any
fellow, though, who isn&#8217;t square and above-board.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shake.&#8221; The black-eyed youth half-raised
himself in his seat and offered Jimmy his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
His companion continued to stare dumbly, as
though dazed by the suddenness of the whole
thing.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you at the recruiting station the other
day,&#8221; observed Roger, addressing the boy who
had offered his hand. &#8220;You were just coming
out of the place as I was going in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw you, too,&#8221; nodded the other. &#8220;That
used to be my business; just seeing people and
things and writing &#8217;em up afterward. I was a
cub reporter on the <em>Chronicle</em>. Then I got the
enlisting habit and here I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every morning I read him, that paper,&#8221; announced
a solemn voice. The dumb had come
into speech. &#8220;<em>You</em> write him?&#8221; The questioning
round blue eyes looked awe upon his seatmate.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha, ha! That&#8217;s a good one,&#8221; shouted the
ex-reporter gleefully. &#8220;Say, Oscar, what do you
take me for?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no my name. It is Ignace; so. Ignace
Pulinski,&#8221; was the calm correction. &#8220;I am
one, a Pole.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, &#8216;Ignace So Pulinski, one, a Pole,&#8217;
you&#8217;ve got another think coming. I used to
write about this much of the <em>Chronicle</em>. See.&#8221;
The boyish news-gatherer indicated a space of
about three inches between his thumb and first
finger.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no much.&#8221; Ignace relapsed into disappointed
silence. Nor did he offer a word<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
when his energetic companions proposed turning
their seat so as to face Jimmy and Roger.
He lumbered awkwardly to his feet and sat
stolidly down again as though moved by invisible
strings.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was lucky to get that some days.&#8221; Now
seated opposite his new acquaintances the reporter
resumed the subject of his recent occupation.
Noting Roger&#8217;s and Jimmy&#8217;s patent
amusement, their friendly <em>vis-a-vis</em> winked
roguishly at them and continued, &#8220;Well, no
more of it for me. What branch of the service
did you fellows enlist in?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Infantry,&#8221; came the concerted answer.
&#8220;We thought we&#8217;d like to be sure of a front
place in the big fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll get it,&#8221; was the grim assurance.
&#8220;This war&#8217;s going to last long after we&#8217;ve hit
the trenches in France and done our bit. We&#8217;re
lucky to be going to Sterling. It&#8217;s one of the
best camps in the country. It was one of the
first to be laid out. I was sent up there by my
paper to get a story about it when it was just
starting. It was nothing but a lot of cornfields
then. I was up there again about three
weeks ago and maybe there wasn&#8217;t a difference,
though! Ground all cleared, company streets
laid out and barracks going up fast. It&#8217;s a
dandy place for a camp. Good and dry with no
swamps. There shouldn&#8217;t be many men on sick
list.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;How large is it?&#8221; inquired Roger interestedly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Covers about eight square miles, I should
say; maybe a little more than that. I hadn&#8217;t
thought of enlisting until after the second trip
to it. Then I just had to step in line. I wasn&#8217;t
going to hang back until the draft got me, like
a lot of fellows I know. I figured it out this
way. If I went into the Army and came out
alive at the end of the war, I&#8217;d have had all the
fun and a barrel of experience. If I got to
France and then went West&mdash;that&#8217;s what they
call it when you cash in your checks&mdash;I&#8217;d have
a lot of fun anyhow while I lasted. I&#8217;d like to
get a whack at the Fritzies, so why lose a chance
at it? Infantry for mine, though, every time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope we are put in the same barrack.&#8221;
This new acquaintance was one strictly after
impetuous Jimmy&#8217;s own heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I.&#8221; A flash of approval sprang to
the young reporter&#8217;s face. His mental appraisal
of Roger and Jimmy had been &#8220;all to
the good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I go by you, an&#8217; you, an&#8217; you, mebbe, huh?&#8221;
Ignace again came to life, accompanying each
&#8220;you&#8221; with a rigid pointing of a stubby forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe, huh,&#8221; agreed Jimmy solemnly.
&#8220;Later on you might be sorry for it, too.
Didn&#8217;t you ever hear about appearances being
deceitful?&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>A slow grin overspread the Pole&#8217;s stolid face.
&#8220;I take the chance,&#8221; he declared, thereby proving
that he was not so stupid as he seemed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a real sport, Iggy.&#8221; His seatmate
playfully slapped him on the shoulder. &#8220;I
guess if you can stand us we can stand you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are no ver&#8217; strong.&#8221; Ignace was evidently
more impressed by the lack of force that
had attended the light blow than by the compliment.
&#8220;My father ver&#8217; strong man,&#8221; he
added with a reminiscent frown.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I hadn&#8217;t expected to knock your head
off,&#8221; conceded the other satirically. &#8220;That was
only a friendly tap.&#8221; Struck by a sudden
thought he asked curiously, &#8220;How&#8217;d you happen
to enlist, Iggy? Are you twenty-one?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a. Twenty-one an&#8217; two weeks. So&#8221;&mdash;the
china-blue eyes took on a defiant glint&mdash;&#8220;run
&#8217;way. My father, he no like this war.
He say I no go &#8217;cause no American. I say, &#8216;go
anyhow.&#8217; Better I think be solder an&#8217; get kill
once than my father most kill when he hit me
much. I work by one mill, but he get all moneys
I make. This is no right, I say many time, and
always get the black eye or the bloody nose. So
go quiet by place an&#8217; say to man there, &#8216;I can be
the solder? I like fight for this country.&#8217; Then
I don&#8217;t go home more. Stay by a frien&#8217; an&#8217; my
father don&#8217;t know nothin&#8217; till too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once started on a recital of his own troubles,
Ignace had hardly stopped for breath. There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
were no smiles on the faces of his listeners when
he had finished. The lack of excitement in his
voice as he droned forth the story of his own
patriotic awakening and his final revolt, brought
a sympathetic gleam into three pairs of eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s time to shake with you, Iggy.&#8221;
Jimmy suited the action to the word by grabbing
the Polish boy&#8217;s rough hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, too,&#8221; called out the reporter. &#8220;Let&#8217;s
all shake and tell our right names. Mine&#8217;s
Robert Dalton. Either Bob or Dal&#8217;ll do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mine&#8217;s Jimmy Blazes, James Blaise when
we have company. This old sobersides is Roger
Barlow. He&#8217;s got to have a shorter name than
that, though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Call him Ruddy and let it go at that,&#8221; suggested
Dalton. &#8220;I used to know a fellow named
Roger. We called him Ruddy or Rodge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either&#8217;ll suit me.&#8221; Roger was secretly
pleased with his new names.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ahem! We have with us this afternoon,
Iggy and Jimmy and Bob and Rodge.&#8221; Dalton
stood up, threw out his chest, thrusting his left
hand pompously inside his coat. &#8220;We&#8217;re here
because we&#8217;re here. Gentlemen, on us depends
the safety of the great American commonwealth.
Until we entered this stupendous conflict,
all was lost. But you can&#8217;t lose us. We&#8217;re
Four Dauntless Dubs Devoted to Daring Deeds.
How&#8217;s that?&#8221; Dalton beamed patronizingly
on the trio, then sat down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Not so bad. We&#8217;re sure enough dubs when
it comes to soldiering!&#8221; smiled Roger. &#8220;I expect
we&#8217;ll feel we&#8217;re less than that if we get
into the awkward squad for being slow for
drill. I&#8217;m not going to stay in the dub class,
though.&#8221; His boyish mouth set in determined
lines. &#8220;I&#8217;m not going to get into the awkward
squad if I can possibly help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some ambitious rookie,&#8221; teased Bob.
&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a great life if you don&#8217;t weaken.
I&#8217;m not saying where I&#8217;m going to land. Just
so I land on both feet every time. When I used
to write in my copy book, &#8216;Obedience is the first
and last duty of a soldier,&#8217; I never thought that
it was going to come home to me like this.
That&#8217;s the whole game in a nutshell, though.
Speak when you&#8217;re spoken to, etc. Throw out
your chest and look happy when you get a call-down.
&#8216;Love your country and can up the
Fritzies before they can you,&#8217; is going to be my
motto. How any husky fellow with good red
blood in his veins can read about what&#8217;s going
on &#8216;Over There,&#8217; and never blink an eyelash, is
more than I can see.&#8221; Bob had grown serious.
&#8220;All I hope is that it won&#8217;t be long until our
turn comes to go over. I might have enlisted
a good while ago. Wish I had. I haven&#8217;t a relative
in the world to worry over except an uncle
who&#8217;s a pacifist, and I&#8217;m not worrying much
about him. Too bad he&#8217;s too old for the draft.
I&#8217;d like to hear him spouting peace to a line of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
charging Boches. This is about the way he&#8217;d
do it!&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob drew down his face, and proceeded to
give an imitation of his peace-loving relative
that made even solemn Ignace laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is good I come sit here,&#8221; congratulated
the Pole. &#8220;You are fonny, but you have the
kind heart. You make of me the fon, I no care.
I no make the fon of you. Somebody hit you.
I hit him. I am the fren&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged, old man.&#8221; Bob looked surprised
and touched at this sudden tribute of
loyalty. &#8220;I can take care of myself, though.
I&#8217;m strong, even if you don&#8217;t think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no the old man,&#8221; corrected Ignace with
dignity. &#8220;Anyhow, I take care you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I certainly seem to be popular with some
people,&#8221; murmured Bob. &#8220;All right, Iggy, you
can go as far as you like. Maybe I do need a
keeper. If you and I land side by side in the
same barrack we&#8217;ll be bunkies, like Jimmy and
Roger. I know a good thing when I meet it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Brothers all!&#8221; Ignace raised a hand as
though pronouncing a benediction.</p>

<p>In the days to come the Polish boy&#8217;s declamation
was to be fulfilled to the letter. From
that chance meeting in the train was to spring
a comradeship between the four young men, all
from such different walks in life, that would do
much toward helping them over the hard ruts
in the Glory Road.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />

<small>ALL IN THE DAY&#8217;S WORK</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;Camp Sterling! Camp Sterling!&#8221; The
stentorian call thrilled the hearts of
the embryo soldiers. Long before the
train had come to a creaking, puffing stop, fifty
boys were on the <em>qui vive</em> to be out of it for a
first satisfactory look at the camp, of which they
had obtained only tantalizing glimpses from the
car windows. Emerging with alacrity from the
train, they made brief halt on the station platform,
while the officer of the bouquet incident
called the roll.</p>

<p>Met at the station by two sergeants from the
camp, the little detachment of future defenders
did their level best to obey promptly the order,
&#8220;Company attention! Forward march!&#8221; Accompanied
by the sergeants, who had come
down to the station to receive them, they were
soon marching away from it and through the
wide gateway that admitted them to the camp
itself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span></p>

<p>Far ahead of them they could see scattered
groups of long, low buildings, which they immediately
knew to be barracks. As they proceeded
straight forward along an almost level
and extremely dusty road, they could make out
more plainly the first outlying group of barracks,
to which they were momently drawing
nearer. Of new, unpainted wood, two-storied
and many-windowed, these buildings looked
rather cheerless at first view. Here and there
at the side or front of one stood small, sturdy
trees, the dark green of their foliage relieving
the prevailing monotonous yellow cast that predominated.</p>

<p>For over a mile they tramped steadily along.
By this time they had long since passed the outlying
groups of barracks, and had had the
chance of viewing numbers of them at close
range. Ordered at last to halt before one of
them, their conductors marched them up a flight
of four wooden steps, and through an open door
into a long, bare room, the chief furnishing of
which consisted of two rows of narrow canvas
cots. Placed fairly close together, these cots
ranged the length of the room on both sides,
leaving a wide aisle in the middle.</p>

<p>Here they were taken in hand by still another
sergeant, who informed them that they were now
in a receiving barracks, where they would sleep
that night prior to being re-examined at a regimental
hospital the next morning. Crisply as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>signed
to cots, they were allowed only time
enough to stow their suitcases and scant luggage
underneath these cots, then were conducted
to the quartermaster to draw mess kits, blankets,
haversacks, and such equipment as is
issued to each man as soon as possible after
arrival at a training camp.</p>

<p>They were ordered to check carefully each
article of the Government&#8217;s property as it was
issued to them, and obliged to sign for it. This
done, they were conducted back to the receiving
barracks, where they spent the brief interval
before mess in neatly arranging their personal
and issued property under the cots which they
would use only temporarily.</p>

<p>The bugle call to mess found them again falling
in for their first trip to a mess hall. Arrived
there, they entered and were marched,
single file, the length of the long room to a
counter at one end, where each in turn received
a goodly portion in his mess kit of the various
eatables that went to make up the meal that
night. These were served to them by the soldiers
detailed for kitchen work, much in the
same fashion that food is served in the city
cafétarias.</p>

<p>The furnishings of the mess hall consisted of
the counter, two large kitchen ranges, a furnace
in the middle of the room, many tables and
rows of uncomfortably hard wooden benches.
Once they had received their portions of food,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
the new arrivals were permitted to choose their
own places at table.</p>

<p>All in all it was the plainest fare that the
majority of the young soldiers had sat down to
for many a day, perhaps the first of its kind for
a few of them who had come from homes of
affluence. It may be said to their credit that
whatever may have been their mental attitude
toward regulation Army fare, they showed no
visible signs of discontent, but fell to and ate
hungrily.</p>

<p>Mess over, it but remained to cleanse their
mess-kits at sinks provided for that purpose.
Then they were taken back to the barrack where
they were to sleep that night, and where they
spent the remaining hours, until Tattoo
sounded, in going over their effects and quietly
visiting with one another. Call to quarters
sounded at 9:45, to be followed by the ten o&#8217;clock
call of Taps.</p>

<p>Awakened the next morning by the clear notes
of a bugle blowing first call, the fifty recruits
lost little time in scrambling from their cots
and getting hastily into their uniforms before
Reveille sounded. Lined up outside the barrack,
a sergeant called the roll. This done, the Khaki
Boys were allowed a brief twenty minutes before
breakfast in which to make up their cots
and perform their morning ablutions at the barrack
sinks. Breakfast at the same mess hall
where they had eaten the previous evening came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
next, then a return to barracks, followed by the
call of &#8220;Assembly&#8221; at a few minutes past
seven.</p>

<p>Directly afterward they were escorted to the
hospital for the final examination that was to
prove beyond a doubt their physical fitness to
become soldiers in the National Army of the
Republic. Out of the fifty who went to hospital
that morning only three failed to measure
up to the standard, which meant that for them
all hope of a military career in the great war
was ended.</p>

<p>None of the four &#8220;Brothers,&#8221; however, were
among this unlucky trio. Bob Dalton, Jimmy
Blaise, Roger Barlow and Ignace Pulinski were
pronounced physically fit in every respect. For
them, the Glory Road was open so far as being
acceptable specimens of young American manhood
went. Their examinations ended by eleven
o&#8217;clock that morning. They were then regularly
sworn into the Army and shortly afterward
drew their uniforms. First attempts at
donning them were attended with considerable
difficulty. All four had trouble in smoothly adjusting
the canvas leggings. Ignace in particular
groaned and grumbled at the task until
Jimmy mercifully went to his assistance. When
fully dressed none of them were without a feeling
of awkwardness. It would take time for
them to grow accustomed to their new attire.</p>

<p>Late afternoon of the same day saw them es<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>tablished
at last as members of Company E,
509th Infantry, in one of the barracks assigned
to that regiment. It had, indeed, been a busy
day for the four Khaki Boys. The barracks in
which they were now quartered was a considerable
distance from the one in which they had
passed their first night in camp. It had, therefore,
taken some little time to remove their effects
to it, not to mention a further visit to the
quartermaster to obtain a number of necessary
articles which they still lacked.</p>

<p>Mess over that night, the tired quartette were
glad of a chance to lounge in their new quarters,
there to discuss among themselves the, to
them, unusual events of that long day. Greatly
to their satisfaction they had not been separated,
but occupied four cots together in a row,
with Roger and Jimmy in the middle and Ignace
and Bob on either side of the two.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow our real military life begins,&#8221;
exulted Roger. &#8220;I wonder how long we&#8217;ll be
taken out for drill, and whether we&#8217;ll be in the
same squad or not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope we don&#8217;t land in the awkward squad
the very first shot,&#8221; commented Bob. &#8220;The
drill sergeant&#8217;s supposed to go easy with rookies
for the first day or two. An enlisted man I
know, who&#8217;s been in the Army for the past three
years, once told me that it depends a whole lot
on the officer who does the drilling. If he&#8217;s an
old-timer who&#8217;s seen service he&#8217;s more apt to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
be patient with a rookie than if he&#8217;s just won
his chevrons. A newly made drill sergeant is
more likely to get peppery and bawl a rookie
out before the whole squad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to know a little bit about this drill
game. The last year I was in grammar school
some of us kids got the soldier fever and organized
a company of our own,&#8221; reminisced
Jimmy. &#8220;The brother of one of the fellows belonged
to the National Guards and he used to
drill us. There were about twenty of us, and
we drilled in our garret once a week for a whole
winter. We&#8217;d planned to go camping together
the next summer and sleep in tents and all that,
like real soldiers. Then some of the fellows got
to scrapping and our company broke up. We
had uniforms something like those the Boy
Scouts wear and wooden guns. Hope I haven&#8217;t
forgotten what little I learned. Maybe it&#8217;ll help
me now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it would.&#8221; Bob
regarded Jimmy with interest. &#8220;You&#8217;ll probably
be quicker at catching the swing and
rhythm of things than the rest of us. Being
familiar with the commands ought to help
some.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am the dumb,&#8221; broke in Ignace, who had
been gloomily listening to the conversation of
the trio.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span> &#8220;If this day I no brother help me what
I do? Yet must I be the good solder. I have
said an&#8217; so am I, som&#8217; day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done the best you could, old man,&#8221;
comforted Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;ll learn. So don&#8217;t cry
about it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never I cry the tear,&#8221; was the somewhat
reproachful retort to Bob&#8217;s kindly chaffing.
&#8220;Only the littles an&#8217; the &#8217;ooman cry. I am the
man. I no cry my father hit me, I no cry now.
So is it.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had been anything but a red-letter day for
the Pole. Bewildered by the rapidity with
which things happened in Camp Sterling, Ignace
had been hustled here and there like a
sheep to slaughter. Only the kindly proddings
and promptings of his three self-adopted
Brothers had saved him from being set down
as intolerably stupid in the minds of the efficient
officers and men with whom he had already
come in contact.</p>

<p>In reality Ignace was not as stupid as he
appeared. Years of unremitting, slavish toil
had undoubtedly made him slow and clumsy of
movement. He had not the quick faculty of
adapting himself to new conditions, which is one
of the most striking characteristics of the
American the world over. He was also likely
to come to grief frequently through his imperfect
knowledge of English. In spite of all these
handicaps, his will to become a good soldier was
so paramount that his three friends were of the
opinion that somehow he would plod along to
that end. Moreover, they had privately agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
among themselves to do all in their power to
help him.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the talk,&#8221; commended Jimmy.
&#8220;Never say die till you&#8217;re dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then can I no say,&#8221; supplemented Ignace
so positively as to create a general snicker. It
dawned upon him that he had provoked it, and
a slow grin overspread his usually immobile
face. He was beginning to understand the vernacular
of his &#8220;Brothers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve got a lot to learn,&#8221; sighed Roger.
&#8220;All I can see to do is to get busy and learn it.
I&#8217;ve been trying to look as much like a first-class
private as I could since I drew my uniform.
Jimmy has us all beaten when it comes
to that, though. His uniform blouse looks as
though it grew on him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy appeared radiantly pleased at Bob&#8217;s
candid praise. Unconsciously he drew himself
up with a proud little air that was vastly becoming
to him. &#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not so much,&#8221; he demurred.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t let it go to your head and swell it,
Blazes,&#8221; teased Bob. &#8220;Look at me and think
what you might have been. To-night you see
before you a simple, hopeful rookie. To-morrow
at drill you&#8217;ll see a sore and hopeless dub.
I expect to get mine; but not forever. Live and
learn. If you can&#8217;t learn you&#8217;ve got a right to
live, anyhow. A few gentle reminders from a
drill sergeant that you&#8217;re a dummy won&#8217;t put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
you in the family vault. A little mild abuse&#8217;ll
seem like home to me. I&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m back on
the <em>Chronicle</em> listening to the city editor. It
takes a newspaper man to read the riot act to a
cub reporter. Nothing left out and several
clauses added.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s untroubled attitude toward what lay
in wait for him on the morrow had a cheering
effect on Jimmy and Roger. Ignace, however,
sat humped up on his cot a veritable statue of
melancholy. Decidedly round-shouldered, his
stocky figure showed at a glaring disadvantage
in the trim olive-drab Army-blouse.</p>

<p>Jimmy&#8217;s glance coming to rest on the dejected
one, he counseled warningly: &#8220;You&#8217;d better
practice holding back your shoulders, Iggy.
They need it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignace obediently straightened up. &#8220;Too
much mill,&#8221; he explained. &#8220;All time so.&#8221; He
illustrated by bending far forward. &#8220;Mebbe
better soon. Huh?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll have to keep on the job all the while,
then,&#8221; was Jimmy&#8217;s blunt assertion.</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I.&#8221; Ignace sighed, then braced himself
upon the edge of his cot to a position of
ramrod stiffness that was laughable, yet somehow
pathetic. Occupied with the ordeal, he took
small part in the low-toned talk that continued
among his Brothers, but sat blinking at them,
now and then slumping briefly and recovering
himself with a jerk. Shortly before the 9:45<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
call to quarters sounded, he dropped over on his
cot and went fast asleep. Sound of the bugle
brought him to his feet with a wild leap and a
snort that nearly convulsed his comrades, and
brought the eyes of a dozen or more of rookies
to bear upon him. Among them was a tall,
freckle-faced, pale-eyed youth with a sneering
mouth, who bunked directly across the aisle
from the four Khaki Boys.</p>

<p>Viewing Ignace with a grin of malicious
amusement, he addressed a remark to his
nearest neighbors that caused them to burst into
jeering laughter. Quick to catch its scornful
import, Jimmy shot an angry glance across the
room. Beyond an occasional cursory survey of
his rookie companions of the barrack, he had
paid them small attention. Now in his usual
impetuous fashion he conceived an instant dislike
for the freckle-faced soldier, which he never
had reason to change. For a second the two
stared steadily at each other. Across the narrow
space sped a silent declaration of war to the
knife. Had Jimmy been gifted with the ability
to read the future, he would have been considerably
amazed to learn what the outcome of
that mute declaration was destined to be.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />

<small>THE BEAUTY OF GOOD ADVICE</small></h2>


<p>During the first three days in camp the
four Khaki Boys could not get over the
awkward feeling of having been suddenly
set down in the midst of a strange and
confused world. Taken out for drill on the second
morning after their arrival at Camp
Sterling, their first encounter with a drill sergeant
did not tend to make them feel strictly at
home in the Army. It served, instead, to bring
out sharply to them a deep conviction of their
own imperfections.</p>

<p>Greatly to their secret disappointment, they
were not all assigned to the same squad. Bob
and Roger were placed in one squad, Ignace and
Jimmy in another. Of the four, Jimmy Blaise
acquitted himself with the most credit. Blessed
with a naturally fine carriage, lithe of movement
and quick of perception, he showed every
promise of becoming a success as a soldier. Undoubtedly
his previous, though amateur train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>ing,
now stood him in good stead. Added to
that was a genuine enthusiasm for things
military.</p>

<p>Schooled in the work-a-day world, Roger and
Bob were also of excellent material. Both had
learned to move quickly and obey promptly.
Roger&#8217;s chief assets were earnestness of purpose
and absolute dependability. Less earnest
and more inclined to whimsicality, Bob was possessed
of an alertness of brain that enabled him
to comprehend instantly whatever was required
of him. So the two were fairly well-matched
and needed practice only in order to develop and
bring out their latent soldierly qualities.</p>

<p>Poor Ignace alone seemed determined to
cover himself with confusion. Drilled in the
same squad with Jimmy, he was from the start
a severe trial to the efficient, but hot-headed
young sergeant in charge. Slow to think and
slower to act, he immediately became a mark
for criticism. His awkward carriage and shuffling
walk were an eye-sore to that trim, capable
officer.</p>

<p>During the first day&#8217;s drilling of the squad to
which Ignace belonged, the sergeant showed becoming
patience with the clumsy Pole&#8217;s painful
efforts to obey orders. Two trying sessions
with Ignace on the next day sent his scanty
stock of forbearance to the winds. At the morning
drill the sergeant had, with difficulty, mastered
his growing irritation. Ordered out for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
drill again that afternoon, Ignace received the
rebuke that had been hovering behind the sergeant&#8217;s
lips since first he had set eyes on the
unfortunate Pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;See here, you,&#8221; rapped out the disgusted
&#8220;non-com,&#8221; after a particularly aggravated
display of awkwardness had aroused his pent-up
ire. &#8220;Where do you think you are, anyway?
This is no boiler-factory. You&#8217;re in the Army
now! Lift up your feet! You&#8217;re not stubbing
along to work. Pick up your head! First thing
you know you&#8217;ll be stepping on your neck.
That&#8217;s a little more like it. Now hold it for two
minutes, if you can. If you can&#8217;t&mdash;into the
awkward squad you go to-morrow. Pay attention
and do as you&#8217;re told <em>when</em> you&#8217;re told.
Every time you make a move you make it just
in time to queer your squad. Now this is the
last time I&#8217;m going to tell you. I&#8217;ve got something
better to do than splitting my throat yelling
at you.&#8221;</p>

<p>This scathing bawling-out of unlucky Ignace
occurring just before the drill ended, he escaped,
for that day at least, the humiliation of
being bundled into the dreaded awkward squad.
But to-morrow was yet to be reckoned with. In
consequence, he looked a shade more melancholy
than usual when, the drill period over, he dejectedly
moped along toward the barracks with
Jimmy.</p>

<p>A short distance from it, they encountered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
Bob and Roger, who were also returning from
a period of, to them, strenuous drill. As recruits,
it would be some little time before they
would be ready to adhere to the regular daily
program of infantry drill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, fellows!&#8221; greeted Bob. &#8220;Hike along
with us and let&#8217;s hear the latest. How goes
drill?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, pretty fair.&#8221; Jimmy shrugged his
shoulders. Ignace, however, shuffled along beside
Jimmy in gloomy silence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cheer up, Iggy.&#8221; Guessing the reason for
the Pole&#8217;s dejection, Bob gave him a friendly
slap between his again sagging shoulders.
&#8220;For goodness&#8217; sake, <em>brace</em> up! When you
hump over like that your coat fits you, <em>not</em>.
You&#8217;d better shove a stick under your arms and
across your shoulders, and spend your time
until Retreat hiking around camp that way.
It&#8217;ll be as good as shoulder braces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I.&#8221; A gleam of purpose, which Bob
failed to note, shot into the Pole&#8217;s china-blue
eyes, as, with a deep sigh, he threw back his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;d better stop shuffling your feet, too.&#8221;
Now on the subject, Bob decided to call his disconsolate
&#8220;Brother&#8217;s&#8221; attention to this unsoldierlike
habit. &#8220;Pick &#8217;em up like this.&#8221; Bob
took a few extravagantly high steps in a purely
waggish spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I,&#8221; came the resolute repetition.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
&#8220;Soon learn I. It is the yet hard. An&#8217; the
words; the words never I un&#8217;erstan&#8217;.&#8221; Ignace&#8217;s
voice held a note of active distress. It
called for sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;What words?&#8221; asked Roger. &#8220;Oh, I know.
Do you mean that you don&#8217;t understand the
commands the sergeant gives you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Som&#8217;time, yes; som&#8217;time, no. When yes,
I do, but too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221; Roger nodded sympathetically.
&#8220;You ought to take my manual and study
it. You can learn all the different commands
from it. Then you&#8217;ll know them when you hear
them and can follow them more easily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never un&#8217;erstan&#8217; I that book. I have read
him, but he is no for me,&#8221; came the dispirited
objection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ha! I&#8217;ve an idea.&#8221; Bob began to laugh.
&#8220;I&#8217;ll fix you up, Iggy. You come around to me
after mess to-night, and I&#8217;ll have a grand surprise
for you. Don&#8217;t you bother me till then,
either, or you won&#8217;t get it. Savvy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a.&#8221; Ignace looked drearily hopeful.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now what have you got up your sleeve?&#8221;
asked Jimmy curiously. Bob was chuckling as
though over something extremely funny.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait and see. What I said to Iggy means
you fellows, too. Run along and take a walk
around Camp Sterling. Sight-seers are always
welcome, you know. Here&#8217;s where I fade away
and disappear.&#8221; With a wave of his hand, Bob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
started on a run for Company E&#8217;s barrack, to
which they had now come almost opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do as he says. We&#8217;ll take a walk
around, and see if we can&#8217;t find a few officers
to try a salute on. I&#8217;ve got to practice that. I
almost bumped into one yesterday. He looked
so prim and starchy I pretty nearly forgot to
salute him.&#8221; Jimmy looked briefly rueful.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. I guess I need a little saluting
practice, too,&#8221; agreed Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can no go. I have the work to do,&#8221; demurred
Ignace. &#8220;Goo-bye. You again see
som&#8217;time.&#8221; Without further explanation, the
Pole turned and scuttled off down the company
street in the direction from which they had
come.</p>

<p>The two he had so unceremoniously deserted
stopped to watch him. Somewhat to their surprise
they saw him suddenly leave the street
and set off across a stretch of open ground
sloping a little above the camp.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s he up to now, I wonder?&#8221; mused
Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hard to tell. Those Poles are queer. He&#8217;s
a splendid fellow, though, not a bit of a coward.
Too bad he has so much trouble about the drill,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221; Roger felt extreme sympathy toward
blundering Ignace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He got his from the drill sergeant this
afternoon. I was afraid he would. Say, do
you know it&#8217;s funny about him. He&#8217;s the last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
fellow I&#8217;d have ever thought of getting chummy
with. At home, I couldn&#8217;t have stood him for
a minute. Yet here, somehow, I kind of like
him. He&#8217;s so sure that we&#8217;re his brothers and
all that, I feel as if I ought to be good to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob smiled. He quite understood Jimmy&#8217;s
attitude. Born of the classes, fortunate Jimmy
had never had much occasion to consider the
masses, particularly the very humblest of the
great army of bread-winners.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s one thing I like about the Army,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s the Service that counts; not
just you or I. A private&#8217;s just a private here,
even if he is a millionaire&#8217;s son back in civil
life. By the time this war is over, a lot of fellows
will have found that out, the same as you
have. It&#8217;s different with me. Iggy seems sort
of my brother, after all, because I&#8217;ve been a
worker, too. He&#8217;s a good, honest fellow and I
like him. That&#8217;s enough for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s square,&#8221; emphasized Jimmy. &#8220;When
a fellow&#8217;s square, he&#8217;s pretty nearly O. K. Iggy&#8217;s
clean and neat, too. That&#8217;s more than I
can say of some of those rookies in our barrack.
Say, did you know that the guy who bunks
next to that fresh Bixton is a German-American?
Schnitzel&#8217;s his name. Wonder how he
happened to enlist. He&#8217;s a queer stick. Never
says a word. Just watches the fellows as if
they were a bunch of wild Indians. Do you
know what that Bixton has been handing around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
the barrack?&#8221; Jimmy scowled as he mentioned
the man whom he so strongly detested.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.&#8221; A faint pucker appeared between
Roger&#8217;s own brows. He had not forgotten Bixton&#8217;s
unnecessary jeering at Ignace. He also
disapproved of the freckle-faced rookie as having
too much to say.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Jimmy, &#8220;I heard he said
that this man Schnitzel acted more like a German
spy, sent here by the Fritzies, than a
Sammy. Can you beat that?&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s question
fully conveyed his disgust.</p>

<p>Roger&#8217;s lips tightened. &#8220;Bixton ought to
have more sense,&#8221; was his curt reply. &#8220;That&#8217;s
a pretty serious story to start about an American
soldier. Are you sure he said it? Did you
get it straight?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep. I told the fellow that told me to can
it. Catch me getting into a mix-up over a yarn
like that. I guess you know how much love I
have for Bixton. Bob&#8217;s down on him. Even
Iggy says, &#8216;Too much speak for nothin&#8217;.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Both boys laughed at the Pole&#8217;s blunt criticism.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like him, either,&#8221; returned Roger
decidedly. &#8220;We&#8217;d better all steer clear of him.
Too bad he&#8217;s in your squad. He&#8217;ll probably
try to make fun of poor old Iggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just let him start something. Great Scott!&#8221;
Jimmy&#8217;s hand went up like lightning. His
quest of an officer to salute had been granted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with a despatch that almost proved fatal to
him. &#8220;Pretty near missed it again,&#8221; he muttered,
as soon as the passing officer, a second
lieutenant, was out of earshot.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw him about a fourth of a second before
you,&#8221; laughed Roger. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t have time
to warn you. That&#8217;s what we get for gossiping.
We must keep our eyes open and our hands
ready from now on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Determined not to be caught napping again,
the two bunkies strolled along, eyes alertly
trained on all passers-by. Following the company
street for almost a mile they retraced their
steps, talking confidentially as they went. A
brief stop at the barrack saw them issue from
it with sparkling eyes. The home folks had
stolen a march on them in the matter of letters.
Jimmy was the proud recipient of three, while
Roger had been made happy with a kindly note
from Mrs. Blaise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go up there to those woods and sit
on that stump fence to read &#8217;em,&#8221; proposed
Jimmy. &#8220;No use going back to barracks. Old
Bob will have a fit if we butt in on his great
stunt, whatever that is.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger acquiescing, the two left the street, unconsciously
taking almost the same route which
Ignace had traveled. It was not more than a
quarter of a mile to the irregular stump fence
that skirted the bit of woodland.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Gee, it looks great up among those trees.
Come on.&#8221; Clearing the fence at a bound,
Jimmy forgot his newly-acquired dignity and
raced along through the woods with the joyous
friskiness of a small boy, Roger close behind
him.</p>

<p>A little way back among the trees they came
to a good-sized flat rock and on this the two sat
down to read the news from home. Roger read
Mrs. Blaise&#8217;s note in happy silence. Jimmy,
however, broke into speech about every five seconds.
&#8220;Just listen to this!&#8221; or &#8220;What do you
know about that?&#8221; was his continual cry, followed
by the reading of a line or a paragraph.
One letter alone he declined to share with
Roger. &#8220;This is from my girl,&#8221; was his sheepish
apology. &#8220;She used to live next door to us,
but now she lives in Buffalo. This letter came
to our house after I&#8217;d gone, so Mother sent it
on to me. &#8217;Course, Margaret, that&#8217;s her name,
couldn&#8217;t come down to the train to see me off;
so she wrote, thinking I&#8217;d get it that day.
We&#8217;re just good friends, you know. None of
the love stuff. She&#8217;s a fine little girl, though,
and pretty as a picture.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure she must be.&#8221; Roger&#8217;s eyes twinkled.
Jimmy&#8217;s candid confession amused him
not a little. Silent while Jimmy read the letter,
he became aware of a far-off crackle of brush.
&#8220;Someone&#8217;s coming,&#8221; he announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Huh? Uh-huh,&#8221; returned Jimmy, still deep
in his letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>But no one appeared in sight, although the
faint snapping of twigs under human feet was
still to be heard.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone is walking around on the other side
of that little hill,&#8221; Roger asserted, proud of his
ability to locate the sound. For this is a most
necessary requisite of a soldier.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let &#8217;em walk.&#8221; Jimmy declined to be interested.</p>

<p>&#8220;Just for curiosity, I&#8217;m going to see who it
is.&#8221; Roger rose and strolled quietly toward the
crest of the hill. Three minutes later he was
back, his usually serious face all smiles. &#8220;Come
here,&#8221; he called in an undertone. &#8220;Want to see
something funny? Go cat-footed, though. Let
him hear you and the show will be over!&#8221;</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />

<small>THE BEGINNING OF TROUBLE</small></h2>


<p>Hastily tucking his letter into its envelope,
Jim noiselessly trailed Roger to
the top of the hill. Looking down, they
beheld a most remarkable sight. Back and
forth in the hollow, for a distance of about
twenty feet, marched, or rather pranced, Ignace.
His shoulders rigidly forced back by means of a
long stick, thrust under his arms, he was giving
an exhibition of high stepping that would have
filled Bob with joy. Lifting first one foot, then
the other, to a height of at least two feet, he
traversed the hollow with the airy steps of a
circus pony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s beat it before I howl,&#8221; begged Jimmy,
shaking with suppressed mirth.</p>

<p>As stealthily as they had come, the two beat
a quick retreat down the hill and out of sight
of their industrious Brother, where they could
have their laugh out.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought he&#8217;d do it,&#8221; gasped Jimmy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t let him know we saw him. It would
be a shame to kid him when he&#8217;s so dead in
earnest. But won&#8217;t Bob howl? Oh, wait till I
tell him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was certainly rich.&#8221; Roger&#8217;s boyish
laugh rang out afresh. &#8220;It&#8217;ll do him good,
though. I&#8217;ll bet he keeps it up every day. He&#8217;s
afraid of being put in the awkward squad. I
like his grit. He&#8217;ll get there. Now if Bob can
fix him up on the rest. We&#8217;d better be hiking,
Jimmy Blazes. It must be nearly time for
Retreat.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Four-thirty.&#8221; Jimmy consulted a gunmetal
wrist watch. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t wear one of
these at home,&#8221; he added, half apologetically.
&#8220;They&#8217;re too girly-girly. But they&#8217;re all O. K.
out here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish I had one.&#8221; Bob eyed the little watch
with approval. &#8220;I think I&#8217;ll buy one when I get
my first pay. It would be a great convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy agreed that it would. He also made
mental note that he would write certain things
to his mother at once. Well supplied with
pocket money, he decided that he would surprise
his bunkie with a present of a wrist watch
long before pay-day arrived. Roger would
value it doubly as a gift from a Brother.</p>

<p>&#8220;What if poor old Iggy forgets to come out
of the woods in time for Retreat?&#8221; Having
now descended the slope and almost reached the
company street on which their barrack was situ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>ated,
Roger paused to glance anxiously back
toward the woods.</p>

<p>&#8220;Think we&#8217;d better skate back after him?&#8221;
Jimmy&#8217;s gaze followed Roger&#8217;s.</p>

<p>As they stared toward the woods, a familiar
figure came loping down to the stump fence.
Iggy was still decorated with his makeshift
shoulder brace. Scrambling over the fence, the
Pole stopped and laboriously divesting himself
of the stick, tucked it under a projecting stump.
Straightening up, he threw back his shoulders
and came slowly forward, careful to lift his
heavy feet well from the ground, though in a
now-modified fashion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you see him tuck away his shoulder
brace?&#8221; snickered Jimmy. &#8220;That means to-morrow
same time, same place. No awkward
squad for Iggy. It&#8217;s Jimmy&#8217;s little old bunch
for him. Ignace So Pulinski&#8217;s going to stick
by his brother James, if he has to step clear
over the barracks to do it. Let&#8217;s hustle, so we
can tell old Bob before Iggy comes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Vastly amused by what they had so lately
witnessed, the two strode rapidly along toward
their barrack, to acquaint Bob with the exploits
of Ignace before that aspirant toward military
proficiency should put in an appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, how&#8217;s the great stunt?&#8221; inquired
Jimmy. On entering the barrack, he had hurried
ahead of Roger, who had stopped to speak
to a comrade, up the short flight of steps to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
second floor squad room, where the four Khaki
Boys bunked.</p>

<p>Seated cross-legged on his cot, a quantity of
loose sheets of paper scattered broadcast about
him, Bob was making a fountain pen fairly fly
over a pad, braced against one knee. Raising
his head from his writing he grinned amiably.
&#8220;Oh, fine, fine,&#8221; he declared. &#8220;Bobby has certainly
been the busy little rookie. I&#8217;m not done
yet, by a long shot. After mess I&#8217;m going to
see if I can&#8217;t borrow the loan of a typewriting
machine and type this copy.&#8221; He waved a
careless hand over the wide-strewn sheets of
paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;But what&#8217;s that got to do with the great
stunt? Or maybe this <em>is</em> the stunt?&#8221; Jimmy
guessed, nodding toward the papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Clever lad,&#8221; commented Bob. &#8220;This is <em>it</em>.
Mustn&#8217;t touch,&#8221; he warned, as Jimmy reached
out a mischievous hand to gather them in.
&#8220;Can your impetuosity, Jimmy Blazes. Now
watch me rake in the results of two hours&#8217;
genius.&#8221; Bob whisked the papers together in
a jiffy and began patting them into an even
pile.</p>

<p>&#8220;All right, stingy. Just for that I shan&#8217;t tell
you Iggy&#8217;s latest.&#8221; Jimmy turned away, smiling
to himself. He was not in the least peeved.
He merely wanted to arouse Bob&#8217;s curiosity.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;ll keep,&#8221; was the unconcerned answer.
&#8220;It&#8217;s almost time for Retreat, anyhow. I&#8217;ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
hear the terrible tale of illustrious Iggy later,
all right. Better still, I&#8217;ll ask Iggy about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You needn&#8217;t.&#8221; Jimmy swung round with a
jerk. &#8220;Don&#8217;t say a word to him. He doesn&#8217;t
know we know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We? H-m! That&#8217;s you and Ruddy, I suppose.
Then I&#8217;ll quiz old Roger. Here he
comes now with our Polish brother at his heels.
What&#8217;s happened to Iggy? He looks all braced
up. Sort of a strait-jacket effect. What make
of starch do you use, Iggy?&#8221; he waggishly
hailed, as the Pole reached him, holding himself
painfully erect.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see? You think him better?&#8221; Ignace
asked anxiously. &#8220;Yes, but I am the tired!&#8221;
Making a lunge for his cot he bundled himself
upon it in a heap.</p>

<p>&#8220;Complete collapse of the left line,&#8221; murmured
Bob.</p>

<p>Now grown used to the sight of their comrades,
the other occupants of the barrack had
paid small attention to the trio who had just
arrived. Bixton, however, the talkative rookie
whom the four &#8220;Brothers&#8221; so disliked had been
aware of the Pole&#8217;s sudden change of carriage.
A member of the same squad, he had heard the
drill sergeant&#8217;s reprimand of Ignace that afternoon
and accordingly took his cue from it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, Poley, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221; he called
in a purposely loud tone. Ignace had now risen
from his cot and reassumed his strait-jacket<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
appearance. &#8220;Are you practicing for the awkward
squad? You&#8217;ll get there if you live till
to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You too much speak.&#8221; A slow red had
crept into the Pole&#8217;s cheeks. His mild blue
eyes held an angry glint as he turned on his
tormentor who had swaggered up to him. &#8220;I
no like you. You no let me &#8217;lone I give you the
strong poonch.&#8221; Ignace clenched his right hand
menacingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you will, will you? Better not try it.
You&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him alone,&#8221; ordered Jimmy hotly.
&#8220;He&#8217;s minding his own business. Now mind
yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who asked you to butt in?&#8221; sneered Bixton.
&#8220;&#8217;Fraid I might give your Poley pet a trimming?&#8221;</p>

<p>The appearance at the head of the stairs of
the acting first sergeant of the squad-room put
an end to the budding altercation. The men
who had begun to gather about the wranglers
prudently left the scene of discord, and
promptly busied themselves with their own
affairs.</p>

<p>Almost immediately afterward the call for
Retreat formation sounded and the recruits
were marshalled out into the company street,
where they stood at attention while the daily
ceremony of lowering the Flag was conducted,
a regimental band in the distance playing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
&#8220;Star Spangled Banner.&#8221; Everywhere in
Camp Sterling at this hour all soldiers not on
detail were expected to stand at attention during
this impressive ceremony, saluting as the
band played the final note.</p>

<p>Our four Khaki Boys found themselves thrilling
in response to the sonorous notes of their
country&#8217;s chosen anthem. All watched with
reverent eyes the dignified descent of that red,
white and blue banner, the sacred emblem of
&#8220;Liberty and Union; Now and Forever; One
and Inseparable.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />

<small>CAUGHT IN HIS OWN TRAP</small></h2>


<p>Call to mess followed at 5:30. It was not
until the four Khaki Boys had performed
their usual stunt of climbing over several
tables with their portions of food, and
were seated in a row along a wall bench, that
Bob reopened the subject of Bixton.</p>

<p>&#8220;The next time that Bixton smarty tries to
jump you, Iggy, don&#8217;t act as though he was
alive,&#8221; was his wrathful advice. &#8220;He&#8217;s a talker
and a trouble maker. Don&#8217;t let him get your
goat. That&#8217;s what he&#8217;s trying hard to do. He
thinks you are easy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I give him the good lick,&#8221; threatened
Ignace, still ruffled.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t doubt you could wipe up the squad-room
floor with him. But what&#8217;s the use of
spoiling the floor?&#8221; Bob demanded whimsically.
&#8220;Let him babble. He likes it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I no like,&#8221; came the sullen protest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither do I,&#8221; sputtered Jimmy. &#8220;He was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
trying to make a show of Iggy. I&#8217;ll hand him
one myself some of these fine days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ruddy and I&#8217;ll come to see both our brothers
when they land in the &#8216;jug&#8217; for scrapping,&#8221;
offered Bob, affably sarcastic. &#8220;Won&#8217;t we,
Rud?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, <em>I</em> won&#8217;t.&#8221; Roger looked severe. &#8220;If
you two are going to let that Bixton fellow
rattle you, then I can&#8217;t say much for your
good sense. Give him the icy stare a few times
and he&#8217;ll stay in his own corner. Just as long
as he sees he can bother you, he&#8217;ll do it. When
he finds he can&#8217;t, he&#8217;ll quit and start on somebody
else. But that won&#8217;t be your lookout.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I try&#8217;t,&#8221; promised Ignace. His scowling
features clearing, he proceeded to devote himself
sedulously to the savory portion of stew
in the meat can before him. Nor were his companions
loath to drop the unpleasant subject of
Bixton for a hungry appreciation of their food.</p>

<p>The meal finished, the four dutifully cleansed
their mess-kits, returning with them to their
barrack. The evening meal over, the pleasantest
relaxation period of their camp day lay before
them. Until the 9:45 call to quarters they
were free to follow their own bent, so long as
it did not take them beyond camp limits.</p>

<p>After putting away his mess-kit, Bob&#8217;s first
move was to reach under his cot for the suitcase
in which he had deposited his precious papers.
A respectful audience of three stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
watching him, mildly curious as to what he intended
to do next.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does the great stunt come off now?&#8221; smiled
Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet, my boy. I&#8217;m going out on the
trail of a typewriter first. It breaks my heart
to leave you, but it must be did. Half an hour&#8217;s
clickety-clicking and you&#8217;ll see me back here in
all my glory. If the machine downstairs isn&#8217;t
working overtime, maybe I can grab it for a
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go over to the &#8216;Y&#8217; and write letters,&#8221;
proposed Jimmy. &#8220;Our room&#8217;s better than our
company with old Mysterious Myra here. If I
don&#8217;t answer mine bang-up quick, I&#8217;ll never
write &#8217;em. Here&#8217;s enough paper and envelopes
for the bunch.&#8221; Reaching under his
cot he held up a good-sized box of stationery.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would to poor my mother a letter in
American write, but she can no read that
write,&#8221; offered Ignace sadly. &#8220;I can the
American read and write but no my family.
My mother un&#8217;erstan&#8217; American little but no
read.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Write it in Polish, then,&#8221; suggested Jimmy.
&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to write it in English, do
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I want show poor my mother how that
I am smart it to do.&#8221; Ignace was bent on distinguishing
himself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span> &#8220;She it would much
please.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Couldn&#8217;t someone read it to her, then?&#8221;
asked Bob. &#8220;One of her neighbors; or maybe
your groceryman.&#8221; Familiar with the Polish
section of the city from whence Ignace had
come, Bob was somewhat acquainted with the
ways of the clannish Poles. He knew that they
were prone to gravitate to the grocery store in
their neighborhood for everything from merchandise
to general information.</p>

<p>&#8220;S-o-o! I have no think to that.&#8221; Ignace
brightened. &#8220;I write him American anyhow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop in about eighty-thirty and watch <em>Mysterious
Myra</em> conduct a seance.&#8221; Bob cast a
withering glance at Jimmy. &#8220;You ought to be
ashamed to ticket a bunkie with such a handle,&#8221;
he added severely. &#8220;Now get out of here quick
before I smite you.&#8221; He made a playful pass
at Jimmy.</p>

<p>Equally in fun, the latter raised an arm as
though to return it.</p>

<p>A sudden cry of, &#8220;Fight! Fight!&#8221; echoed
through the room, and caused both Jimmy and
Bob to whirl. Directly across from them Bixton
had been morosely watching the quartette.
Aware that the bit of by-play was merely fun,
he had called out &#8220;Fight!&#8221; with malicious intent.
Knowing the acting first sergeant to be
at one end of the room, he had shouted with
a view toward creating trouble. His essay succeeded
so far as to bring the officer to the group
on the run.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s this?&#8221; he questioned, sternly surveying
four very calm but very injured young
men. &#8220;What&#8217;s the trouble here?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;None that we know of,&#8221; answered Roger
respectfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then who called out &#8216;Fight!&#8217;?&#8221; snapped the
non-com.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was not one of us.&#8221; Roger evaded a
direct reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; The sergeant shot a quick glance
about the almost empty room. His keen eyes
coming to rest on Bixton he made directly for
him. &#8220;Did you call out &#8216;Fight!&#8217;?&#8221; he queried
sharply.</p>

<p>Caught in his own trap, the color mounted to
Bixton&#8217;s freckled face. &#8220;Yes.&#8221; The reply was
grudgingly made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why did you do it? Did you <em>see</em> anyone
fighting?&#8221; demanded the sergeant satirically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I did,&#8221; mumbled the man.</p>

<p>&#8220;You <em>thought</em> you did,&#8221; emphasized the non-com.
He thereupon launched into a tirade of
sarcastic rebuke that fell like verbal hailstones
on the would-be trouble-maker&#8217;s ears.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, let&#8217;s beat it,&#8221; muttered Jimmy.
&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy I could hug that sergeant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Leaving Bob to smile seraphically as he busied
himself with his papers, the three made a
discreet exit, the voice of the nettled non-com
still beating upon their ears as they scampered
down the stairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the time he got his,&#8221; exulted Jimmy
as they emerged from the barrack.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must have been watching us,&#8221; commented
Roger. &#8220;When he saw Bob and you
making passes at each other he thought he&#8217;d
start something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He get the fool,&#8221; chuckled Ignace.</p>

<p>&#8220;He certainly did,&#8221; agreed Jimmy joyfully.
&#8220;If he gets off with a call-down, he&#8217;ll do well.
I&#8217;ll bet that sergeant has him spotted for a
talker. Hope he has. Then Smarty Bixton&#8217;ll
get the worst of it if he tries to queer us again.
Maybe he&#8217;s learned something by this time that
wasn&#8217;t down in his books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s heading for the rocks,&#8221; Roger said
soberly. &#8220;Somebody ought to try to set him
straight. I wish he hadn&#8217;t started on Iggy the
way he has. We couldn&#8217;t say a word to him
now. It would only make things worse. We&#8217;ll
just have to do as we agreed and not notice
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>The looming up of a second lieutenant in their
path brought three hands up in smart salute and
temporarily closed further discussion of Bixton.
Reaching the Y. M. C. A., Jimmy distributed
note-paper with a lavish hand and soon the trio
had settled themselves on hard benches before
the primitive-looking desks to write their
letters.</p>

<p>Provided with an extra fountain pen of
Jimmy&#8217;s, Ignace stared blankly at the wall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
sighed profoundly, gingerly tried the pen, and
finally gave himself up to the painful throes of
composition. Jimmy dashed into his letter-writing
with his usual reckless impetuosity, his
pen tearing over the paper at a rapid rate. In
consequence he was triumphantly signing
&#8220;Jimmy&#8221; to his second letter before Roger had
half finished his carefully worded note to Mrs.
Blaise.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hurry up, slow-pokes. It&#8217;s eight-ten,&#8221; adjured
Jimmy, as he scrawled an address across
an envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;Him is done,&#8221; proudly announced Ignace,
holding up his epistolary effort. Undated and
unpunctuated, it began at the very top of the
sheet and ended halfway from the bottom of the
first page. &#8220;Now you read.&#8221; He proffered it
to Jimmy.</p>

<p>The latter took it and with difficulty kept a
sober face as he read:</p>

<p>&#8220;poor mi mothar so am i the bad son wen i
run away but i can no stan the bete my fathar
giv all tim now am i the solder an he can no get
mor i sen you the monee wen i get som tim i hav
the 3 brothar now i hapee but no wen think you
poor mi mothar from you son Ignace.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a good letter, Iggy.&#8221; Jimmy had
lost his desire to laugh as he handed it back. It
had begun to strike him as pathetic. He was
wondering how it had happened that before
meeting the poor Polish boy he had never cred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>ited
that humbler half of the world, in which
Ignace had lived, with human emotions.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can the read better the write,&#8221; assured
Ignace grandly, well pleased with the other&#8217;s
praise. &#8220;I write the name, the street my
mother, you write again this?&#8221; he asked, holding
up an envelope.</p>

<p>Much amused, Jimmy complied. Ignace surveyed
the envelope with admiration. &#8220;How
gran&#8217; is the write my brother,&#8221; he commented.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some compliment. Here&#8217;s a stamp, Iggy.
Stick it on and away we go. Finished yet, old
top?&#8221; This to Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221; Methodically Roger sealed and
stamped the envelope he had just addressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Look who&#8217;s here!&#8221; exclaimed Jimmy. His
gaze roving idly down the big room, he had
spied Bob Dalton just entering it.</p>

<p>Discovering his chums in the same instant,
Bob steered straight for them, his black eyes
twinkling with mischief. &#8220;Three whoops for
Mysterious Myra,&#8221; he hailed, waving a little
sheaf of papers above his head. &#8220;Got through
typing sooner than I expected, so I beat it over
here in a hurry. This is an exclusive stunt. It
calls for an exclusive place. Too much publicity
at the barrack. Come on over in that
corner and help yourself to a front seat while
I read you Dalton&#8217;s Marvelous Military Maneuvers
in Rhyme, respectfully dedicated to the
daily use of Ignace So Pulinski.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />

<small>A MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;You ought to be grateful to me for the
rest of your life, Iggy,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s
bantering peroration when the four
had taken possession of the deserted and therefore
desirable corner.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a. So am I.&#8221; Ignace looked more
dazed than grateful. He had not the remotest
idea of what Bob was driving at.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen hard, Iggy, and try to get this.
Ahem!&#8221; Clearing his throat the rhymster shot
a mirthful glance at Ignace and began to read,
emphasizing each word for the Pole&#8217;s benefit.</p>


<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">&#8220;&#8216;Attention,&#8217; means, &#8216;Eyes to the Front.&#8217;</div>
<div class="verse">Stand on both feet to do this stunt.</div>

<div class="verse">Feet out at forty-five degrees.</div>

</div></div>


<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>By the time he had reached the middle of the
jingle, Jimmy and Roger were smiling broadly.
They, at least, had come into complete understanding
of the &#8220;great stunt.&#8221; The Pole&#8217;s
stolid face was a study. Light was just beginning
faintly to dawn upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you get it?&#8221; Bob asked him, his black
eyes dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a. Som I get. You read him &#8217;gain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. I&#8217;m going on to the next. When I&#8217;m
through, I&#8217;m going to give you these rules for
your own. You must study &#8217;em and learn &#8217;em.
See?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a. Thank.&#8221; Ignace beamed seraphic
joy at his poetic benefactor. &#8220;So will I,&#8221; he
vowed fervently.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go ahead and tear off some more,&#8221; begged
Jimmy impatiently. &#8220;Myra&#8217;s sure some poet.&#8221;</p>

<div class="p">&#8220;I&#8217;ll give you a few of &#8217;em just to be obliging
and to show I don&#8217;t mind being called Myra.
You can read the rest yourselves. When you
get enough, snap the lever and the talking machine
will go dead. All right, Mr. Dalton. So
kind of you.&#8221; Bob smirked, grimaced, then
continued:

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Anybody want to snap the lever?&#8221; Bob
looked up with an inquiring grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221; Roger eyed the rhymster with
genuine admiration. &#8220;It&#8217;s bully. Go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like. Much I un&#8217;erstan&#8217;. You read him
more. Byme by you give me I stoody all time.&#8221;
The Pole showed actual signs of enthusiasm.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the idea, else why is Bobby a bum
poet?&#8221; Pleased, nevertheless, at his success,
Bob resumed.</p>


<div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>


<p>With this last line of sage advice, Bob
stopped reading. &#8220;This talking machine has
an automatic brake,&#8221; he declared. Deftly shuffling
the typed sheets into numerical order he
handed them to Ignace with a flourish. &#8220;Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
go to it, old chap. Stay on the job until you
can say &#8217;em backward. There are about a dozen
more that I didn&#8217;t read out loud. If you don&#8217;t
understand &#8217;em trot &#8217;em around to me and I&#8217;ll
set you straight. Practice every move as you
say it and you&#8217;ll soon be O. K. After you get
them learned, the rest will come easier to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank! Thank!&#8221; Ignace clutched the papers
gratefully. Pride of his new acquisition
made him reluctant to let Roger and Jimmy
take them long enough to read the balance of
the verses.</p>

<p>&#8220;Show&#8217;s over. We&#8217;d better be moving along.
It&#8217;s twenty-five to ten,&#8221; warned Jimmy at last.
&#8220;You&#8217;re all to the good, Bob. Wish I could
write like you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Forget it.&#8221; Bob waved an inconsequential
hand. &#8220;You&#8217;ve got me beaten already when it
comes to soldiering. So honors are more than
even, I guess. A lot they care up here whether
you wrote the Declaration of Independence or
the latest best seller. You&#8217;re in the Army now,
and in bad, too, unless you can show the drill
sergeant that you&#8217;re a live one.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon I show,&#8221; broke in Ignace eagerly.
&#8220;Here have I the rule. What more?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What indeed?&#8221; murmured Bob, winking
solemnly at Roger.</p>

<p>Leaving the Y. M. C. A., the four Brothers
started briskly toward their barrack, which was
no farther away than would be two ordinary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
blocks in a city. Call to quarters sounded just
as they entered the building. During the short
walk Ignace had ambled along in happy silence,
holding tightly to his treasure trove. He was
secretly wondering which of his three Brothers
he liked best and what he could do for them
to prove his loyalty. Just now he could think
of nothing to do that seemed worth while, except
to work hard and show them that he could
be a good &#8220;solder.&#8221; He resolved to study night
and day the &#8220;fonny&#8221; rules Bob had written for
him. Could Bob have foreseen the outcome of
this firm resolve, he might have considered well
before supplying Ignace with the rhymed record
of instruction he had just delivered into his
Polish bunkie&#8217;s keeping with the advice, &#8220;Stay
on the job until you can say &#8217;em backward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There! We forgot to mail our letters,&#8221;
commented Roger regretfully to Jimmy as he
began removing his shoes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too late now. Taps&#8217;ll sound in a minute.
I&#8217;ll mail &#8217;em all the first thing in the morning,
right after breakfast. Give me yours now.
I&#8217;ll get Iggy&#8217;s and put &#8217;em all together on the
top of my shelf. If you happen to think of it
first, remind me of them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Collecting from Ignace the one letter he had
written, Jimmy placed it, together with his own
and Roger&#8217;s, on top of a little folding shelf
above his bunk. He had brought it from home
and it held his father&#8217;s and mother&#8217;s photo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>graphs.
It also boasted of several kodak prints.
There was one of the girl friend with whom
he had grown up, another of Buster, his dog,
and still another of himself, seated in &#8216;Old
Speedy.&#8217; &#8220;They&#8217;re all here,&#8221; he had remarked
to Roger as he had set them in place, &#8220;even to
Old Speedy.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sleep soon visited the eyelids of the four
Khaki Boys. Having been more active than
usual that day they were quite ready for a good
night&#8217;s rest. The last to drop into slumber,
Roger was the first to awaken the next morning.
Long accustomed to rising at a few minutes past
five o&#8217;clock, he had found himself awake before
first call blew each morning since his arrival in
camp. His eyes opening to greet the daylight
pouring in at the windows, his gaze roved idly
over the rows of sleeping soldier boys. Remembrance
of Jimmy&#8217;s request concerning the
letters sent his glance next straying toward the
shelf where he had seen his bunkie place them.
They were not there now. Roger stared frowningly
at the shelf, then his face cleared. Jimmy
had evidently taken them from there and put
them elsewhere. Perhaps in his suit-case. As
soon as Jimmy was awake he would ask about
them. He was sleeping so peacefully now. It
would be a shame to disturb him before first
call. Jimmy always slept until the last minute,
then fairly dashed into his uniform.</p>

<p>Deciding that he would begin to dress, Roger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
slipped quietly from his cot and began methodically
putting on his clothing. When the clarion
notes of the bugle, sounding first call, split the
drowsy air, he was fully dressed and seated on
the edge of his cot, watching with quiet amusement
the orderly flurry that had commenced all
around him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s my shoe?&#8221; came presently in desperate
tones from Jimmy, thus centering
Roger&#8217;s attention upon his friend. &#8220;It was
right beside the other last night. I&#8217;ll swear to
it that I put it there. Now it&#8217;s gone!&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s
voice rose anxiously on the last word. By this
time the call of &#8220;I can&#8217;t get &#8217;em up&#8221; was echoing
through the barrack.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is him.&#8221; From under his own cot,
where Ignace was just snatching his own shoes,
he drew Jimmy&#8217;s missing one and slid it along
the bare floor.</p>

<p>Jimmy swooped down upon it with a gurgle of
relief. Not stopping to inquire how it had wandered
there, he hastily put it on and went on
dressing at breakneck speed, barely finishing
before Reveille, the third and last warning before
roll call.</p>

<p>Concern for his bunkie&#8217;s loss drove the subject
of the letters from Roger&#8217;s mind. Returning
into the barrack after roll call to make themselves
presentable before breakfast, recollection
of the missing letters came back to Roger with
dismaying force.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget your letters, Jimmy,&#8221; he reminded.</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged. I <em>had</em> forgotten. That shoe
business rattled me. I&#8217;ll cinch them now before
I visit the sink to make myself beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>A few quick strides and he had reached his
cot. Following, Roger heard him exclaim:
&#8220;What in Sam Hill!&#8221; Whirling with a grin he
called out, &#8220;You old fake! You&#8217;ve got those
letters! All right. You can just mail &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I haven&#8217;t,&#8221; came the earnest denial.
&#8220;When I first woke up this morning I looked
at the shelf and saw they were gone. I thought
you&#8217;d put them in some other place.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I put them on <em>that shelf</em>,&#8221; emphasized
Jimmy. &#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, I&#8217;d like to know?
First my shoe turns up under Iggy&#8217;s cot and
then away go all our letters. There&#8217;s something
queer about this. Shoes without feet can&#8217;t
walk off alone. Letters can&#8217;t disappear without
hands. What&#8217;s the answer?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Iggy or Bob took the letters to mail
for you,&#8221; hazarded Roger. &#8220;They&#8217;ve gone
ahead to scrub up for breakfast and we&#8217;d better
do the same. You can ask them about it in the
mess hall. Don&#8217;t bother any more about it now.
Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>Frowning, Jimmy obeyed, feeling a trifle nettled
over the fact of a second annoying disappearance
on the heels of the first.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Did either of you fellows take those letters
to mail?&#8221; was his initial remark to Bob and
Iggy as they met at mess.</p>

<p>Receiving a surprised &#8220;No&#8221; from both,
Jimmy turned to Roger with: &#8220;What do you
know about that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much.&#8221; Roger grew grave as he explained
the situation to Bob and Iggy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Someone got away with them,&#8221; asserted
Bob cheerfully. &#8220;Must be a mighty small someone
who&#8217;d stoop to lift a bunch of letters to the
home folks. Stealing anything from another
fellow is a serious offense in the Army.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should anybody want to do a thing like
that?&#8221; demanded Roger. &#8220;We don&#8217;t know the
fellows in our barrack well enough yet for any
of them to do it for a joke.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no joke,&#8221; was Jimmy&#8217;s savage opinion.
&#8220;It was done for pure meanness. How&#8217;d my
shoe get away down under Iggy&#8217;s bed? Some
fellow in the squad-room has it in for me. If
you don&#8217;t know who he is, well&mdash;I do. I&#8217;ll bet
you my hat Bixton did it to spite me for jumping
him yesterday. Just wait till I see him!
I&#8217;ll&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, you won&#8217;t,&#8221; interposed Bob. &#8220;You&#8217;d
only get in wrong unless you had proof. You
can&#8217;t accuse a fellow offhand of anything like
that and get away with it. Keep your eyes
open and your mouth shut. The only way to
land a criminal is to get evidence that he is one.
The same thing applies to a mischief-maker.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Whoever he is, I&#8217;m not saying it&#8217;s Bixton, he&#8217;ll
think he&#8217;s put one over on you, and so pretty
soon he&#8217;ll try it again. It&#8217;s up to you to pussy-foot
around and catch him at it. Now mind
your Uncle Bob, not a word about these letters
to anyone. You can write some more to your
folks. Just act as if nothing had happened and
do a little watchful waiting. There&#8217;s a time to
speak, but it isn&#8217;t now. So bottle your wrath,
Blazes, and do the Sherlock Holmes act. With
the four Brothers on the job, all keeping a
starboard eye out, believe me, whoever cribbed
those letters will wish sooner or later that he&#8217;d
let &#8217;em alone.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />

<small>THE CROWNING INSULT</small></h2>


<p>Realizing the soundness of Bob Dalton&#8217;s
counsel, his three friends agreed to
abide by it. Nevertheless, Jimmy was
already firmly convinced that he had Bixton to
thank for the strange disappearance of his letters.
He did not hesitate to reiterate the statement
to his chums. Iggy solemnly supported
the theory out of pure devotion to Jimmy. Bob
and Roger refused to commit themselves,
thought privately they were of the same opinion
that suspicion pointed strongly in Bixton&#8217;s
direction. Both knew only too well that it
needed but a word from them to set hot-headed
Jimmy Blazes on the trail of the disagreeable
rookie with a vengeance, a proceeding which,
as Bob had sagely pointed out, would be not
only futile but disastrous to Jimmy as well.</p>

<p>The exigencies of drill that morning drove
the incident from the minds of the four for the
time being. Keyed up to the highest pitch of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
desire to do well, Ignace partially retrieved himself
in the eyes of the impatient drill sergeant.
Though he could not know it, that efficient individual
laid the Pole&#8217;s marked improvement of
carriage to the dressing-down he had launched
at Iggy on the previous day. Proud of his ability
to &#8220;whip these rookies into shape&#8221; he
showed considerably more patience with the
still clumsy recruit, and the end of the morning
drill found Ignace again escaping the dreaded
awkward squad.</p>

<p>Not yet obliged to put in full time at drill, the
squad to which Iggy and Jimmy belonged was
dismissed at 10:30 not to resume their work
until called out again after one o&#8217;clock Assembly.
The instant he was released, Ignace hot-footed
it for barracks, there to begin the
&#8220;stoody&#8221; of Military Tactics as laid down by
Bob. As the latter had shrewdly calculated,
when the idea for them had taken shape in his
fertile brain, he could not have devised a better
way of impressing the first, simple Army commands
on the slow-thinking Polish boy. Aside
from feeling highly honored that his &#8220;smart&#8221;
Brother should have gone to so much trouble for
him, Ignace regarded the jingles with much the
same delight which a child takes in its first book
of nursery rhymes.</p>

<p>Reaching the barrack soon after Ignace,
Jimmy was not surprised to find the latter
seated on his cot, busily engaged in droning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
Rule No. 1 aloud. As it happened the squad-room
was almost deserted. The three or four
rookies it contained beside themselves were
wholly occupied with their own affairs. Thus
Ignace had a free field with no one to object to
the sing-song murmur of his voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on, Iggy,&#8221; Jimmy urged. &#8220;Let&#8217;s go
over to the &#8216;Y&#8217; and write our letters again.
We&#8217;ll have plenty of time before mess, if we
hustle.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can no go.&#8221; Ignace stopped in the middle
of a verse to make this stolid refusal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you want to write to your mother?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Y-e-a. Som&#8217; day. No now. I am the busy.
Better I stoody the rule firs&#8217;. Mebbe to-night
write. Mebbe, no. Now am on job. So stay
I. You see. This morning, no get the cross
word. No yet go to what call you it, that bad
squad? So have I do good. Soon much good.
Pretty soon fine solder, I work hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All right. Keep up the good work.&#8221; Smiling,
Jimmy turned away to get his note-paper.
&#8220;Guess I&#8217;ll stay here and write,&#8221; he added,
half to himself. Extracting a small leather
portfolio from his suit-case, he settled himself
on his cot, his back braced against the wall, and
started the re-writing of his letters. Every
now and then he raised his head to grin at
Ignace, whose voice droned on, a steady, monotonous
murmur. Far from disturbed by the
sound, Jimmy was merely amused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Shortly after their arrival, the barrack contingent
began dropping in by twos and threes,
among them Roger and Bob. Regardless of all
comers, Ignace&#8217;s sing-song recitation never
flagged. Disturbed by the increasing amount of
stir and conversation, his tones rose unconsciously
with it until gradually he became an
object of attention. Nor was he in the least
aware of the curious and mirthful glances
launched in his direction. Even the voices of
his three Brothers, talking together so near to
him, failed to distract his attention from his
&#8220;job.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There sits a living monument to my usefulness,&#8221;
muttered Bob, jerking his head toward
Iggy. &#8220;I wouldn&#8217;t butt in on him for the world.
He&#8217;s forgotten we&#8217;re alive. Just listen to him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger&#8217;s eyes rested for an instant on the absorbed
Pole, then traveled about the squad-room.
What he saw brought a quick frown to
his forehead. &#8220;Iggy,&#8221; he remonstrated.
&#8220;Keep your voice down. You&#8217;re getting
noisy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-o!&#8221; The reciter straightened up with a
jerk as though coming to Attention. &#8220;I no
mean make the noise. You &#8217;scuse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t care,&#8221; Roger laughed. &#8220;I only
told you for your own good. The fellows up
here will start to kid you if you keep it up.
That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank.&#8221; Ignace cast a sheepish glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
about him. Encountering more than one smiling
face he colored slightly, then doggedly returned
to his task. Though his lips continued to
move, his voice was no longer heard. Luckily
for him, his arch-tormentor, Bixton, was absent
from the squad-room and so missed a chance to
jeer at the &#8220;Poley Pet&#8221; as he had sneeringly
dubbed Ignace.</p>

<p>When, shortly before call to mess, he sauntered
into the room, he cast a scowling glance
toward the latter. He had anticipated the
pleasure of seeing &#8220;that thick fathead&#8221; banished
to the awkward squad. In consequence he
was disappointed, not so much on Iggy&#8217;s account,
but more because of Jimmy&#8217;s peppery
championship of the former. He had begun by
jeering at Iggy purely because he considered
him a glaring mark for ridicule. Jimmy&#8217;s interference
had aroused in him a fierce dislike for
both boys which was not likely to die out in a
hurry.</p>

<p>The presence of the acting first sergeant, who
had come up the stairs behind him, alone served
to keep him discreetly within bounds. His
bunkie, however, a lank, hard-featured man,
whose small black eyes had a disagreeable trick
of narrowing until almost half shut, lost no
time in regaling the newcomer with the latest
news from across the aisle, laughing loudly as
he related it. Seated side by side on the latter&#8217;s
cot the two were a fitting pair. At least,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
so Jimmy thought, his usually pleasant mouth
curving scornfully as he viewed them for a second,
then turned his back squarely upon the
obnoxious couple.</p>

<p>At drill that afternoon, Ignace did even better
than in the morning. True, he had not yet
absorbed much of Bob&#8217;s rhymed information.
Still, it had given him a working basis on which
to proceed. It needed only time and the dogged
persistence which so characterized him to give
him a lasting grip on the first principles of
military tactics.</p>

<p>Released from drill, half-past three that
afternoon saw him back in barracks, and engrossed
in the &#8220;stoody&#8221; of his precious jingles.
Now, however, he was minus the company of his
Brothers, who returned to the squad-room after
drill only to go directly out again for a walk
about the camp. With no friendly eye to keep
ward over him, Ignace forgot Roger&#8217;s caution
of the morning and was soon droning away like
a huge bumble-bee. Nor did he evince the
slightest sign of having heard, when from
across the room floated the surly command,
&#8220;Aw, cut it out, you big boob!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;All officer you mus&#8217; saloot,&#8217;&#8221; placidly intoned
Iggy, his gaze glued to his copy. &#8220;&#8216;You
right han&#8217; to you head now&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, you fathead?
You heard me tell you &#8216;cut it out&#8217; once. Isn&#8217;t
that enough?&#8221; This second boorish hail as well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
as the first came from the man, Bixton, who
was lounging on his cot. His longed-for opportunity
had come.</p>

<p>This time Ignace had heard and dimly realized
that he was being most ungently addressed.
His voice breaking off on &#8220;now&#8221; his head came
up with a jerk. His round blue eyes registered
a blank amazement that quickly changed to
active resentment as he fixed them upon the
rookie who had so roughly called out to him.
Half rising from his cot, his strong hands instinctively
clenched themselves. Then he
slowly sank back to his former position, determined
to follow Bob&#8217;s advice, &#8220;just act as
though that smarty wasn&#8217;t alive.&#8221; Out of pure
defiance he again resumed his reciting of the
Salute rule, raising his tones a trifle by way of
showing his utter disregard for the other&#8217;s uncalled-for
attack.</p>

<p>With a sudden spring Bixton left his cot. A
hasty glance about him revealed the fact that
the room was clear of officers. Nor were there
more than half a dozen privates present, including
himself and Ignace. Striding across to
where the latter sat he halted directly in front
of the Pole.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m goin&#8217; to put the sergeant onto you, you
poor fish,&#8221; he blustered. &#8220;How&#8217;d you s&#8217;pose
a fellow can rest with you keeping up that
racket? Now chop it off, or you&#8217;ll get yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>For answer, Ignace calmly laid down one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
the typewritten sheets he was holding and centered
his gaze on another.</p>

<p>&#8220;At &#8216;Forwar&#8217; Mar&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he began unconcernedly.</p>

<p>With a sudden lunge of his right arm, Bixton
snatched at the little sheaf of papers. Unexpected
as was the movement, the Pole&#8217;s grip
on them tightened. One of them came away in
the aggressor&#8217;s clutch, however, with an ominous
tearing sound.</p>

<p>That was the last straw. Insults to himself,
Ignace could endure, but when it came to an
attempt to wrest from him the fruits of Bob&#8217;s
labor he was a changed and raging Iggy. Uttering
a wrathful howl he launched his stocky body
at Bixton with a force that sent them both
crashing to the squad-room floor. The Pole
landing uppermost, his arms wrapped themselves
about his tormentor in an effort to pin
him down.</p>

<p>Of strong and wiry build, Bixton struggled
fiercely to free himself. Over and over the
squad-room floor they rolled, thumping heavily
with every turn. Nearing the end of the room
farthest from the stairway, Iggy succeeded in
tearing himself free and getting a vise-like hold
on his antagonist. The few rookies that had
been present when the fight began now gathered
about the combatants with noisy exclamations
of &#8220;Give it to him, Poley!&#8221;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span> &#8220;You got
him cinched, now hand him one!&#8221; It was
plainly evident with whom their sympathies
lay. Bixton was most thoroughly disliked by
the majority of his comrades.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Ignace Pulinski!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>The utterance was freighted with a degree of
stern disapproval that almost caused the Pole
to relax his grip on his adversary. It proceeded
from Roger Barlow. He had come up
the stairs just in time to hear the cry of &#8220;Give
it to him, Poley!&#8221; Darting the length of the
floor, he had pushed his way into the midst of
the group to behold his usually placid Brother
transformed into an enraged savage.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let him up,&#8221; ordered Roger. &#8220;<em>Let him up,
I say!</em>&#8221; The intense forcefulness of his tones
cut the air like a whip-lash. Long years of
obedience to a superior will now had its effect
upon Ignace. His face distorted with anger,
nevertheless his strong hands fell away from
Bixton&#8217;s prostrate form. Very sullenly he lumbered
to his feet and stepped back a pace, his
fists still doubled.</p>

<p>Freed from that relentless pressure, Bixton
was up in a flash. His pale blue eyes gleaming
with malignant fury, he launched a vicious
upper-cut at Ignace, only to find his punishing
right arm arrested in mid-air by two determined
hands. Anticipating some such move on
Bixton&#8217;s part, Roger had blocked it with lightning-like
swiftness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Help me hold him back, you fellows,&#8221; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
snapped, as Bixton struggled to strike him with
his left arm.</p>

<p>Three pairs of sturdy arms now coming to
Roger&#8217;s aid, Bixton was fairly dragged over to
his cot and bundled upon it, thrashing about
wildly under the pinioning hands. Ignace had
not assisted in this operation. He stood stock-still
at the point where he had let Bixton up,
his face a study. Roger&#8217;s interference had
brought him to his senses. He was beginning
to regret his own display of temper. He had
done just exactly what he had been warned
against doing. Weighted down by a sense of his
own shortcomings, he shuffled over to his cot and
began to pick up his scattered papers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold on to him just a minute more, please.
I&#8217;ve something to say to him.&#8221; With this energetic
direction, Roger&#8217;s own hands relaxed
their grasp on Bixton. &#8220;Now, listen to me,&#8221; he
continued, fixing a steely gaze on the man. &#8220;If
you know when you&#8217;re well off, you&#8217;ll behave
yourself when the fellows let go of you. I don&#8217;t
know what all this is about, and I don&#8217;t care.
Just by pure luck you&#8217;ve escaped the sergeant.
If he&#8217;d come in here as I did and seen you two
fighting, you&#8217;d both be in the guard-house by
now. He&#8217;s likely to come in any minute, so
watch yourself. That&#8217;s all. Break away,
boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>Released, Bixton shot up from his cot like a
jack-in-the-box.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span> &#8220;Trying to screen your pet,
are you?&#8221; he sputtered. &#8220;Well, you can&#8217;t.
He&#8217;s going to get his, all right, the minute the
sarge hits the squad-room. I&#8217;ll teach that
pasty-faced hulk a thing or two!&#8221;</p>

<p>For all his bluster, he made no attempt to
attack either Roger or his companions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Better hold your tongue,&#8221; advised Roger
dryly, looking the bully squarely in the eye. &#8220;It
takes two to make a fight, you know. I wouldn&#8217;t
bank too much on the sergeant&#8217;s seeing it differently.
Come on, fellows. Leave him to think
it over.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger turned away, followed by an extremely
disgusted trio of young men. He did not consider
it necessary to enjoin them to silence.
Bixton&#8217;s threat to tell tales to the sergeant had
merely put him in deep disfavor with them.
In the Army or out, no self-respecting man will
countenance a tale-bearer.</p>

<p>Roger went over to Ignace, who had now
slumped down on his cot in an attitude of utter
dejection. He had hard work to keep from
smiling. He did not doubt for an instant that
Ignace had had just cause for his outbreak.
Nevertheless, he put on an air of severity that
he was far from feeling. &#8220;What started this
fight?&#8221; he asked sharply. &#8220;Didn&#8217;t Bob and I
both warn you not to notice that fellow? Do
you know where you&#8217;ll land if the sergeant
hears of this? You&#8217;ll land in the guard-house
for a month, maybe. I shouldn&#8217;t be very sorry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
for you, if you did. Get up and let me brush
you off. Your uniform&#8217;s covered with dust.&#8221;</p>

<p>Without a word Ignace meekly stood up.
Reaching under his own cot for his clothes
brush, Roger put it into energetic use on his now
chastened Brother. &#8220;I&#8217;m surprised at you,&#8221; he
rebuked, between strokes. &#8220;You need a keeper,
Iggy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I the bad one,&#8221; Ignace agreed
mournfully. &#8220;But I feel to kill w&#8217;en that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
English failing him, he paused, then added a
string of Polish words which Roger could only
guess at as not being complimentary to Bixton.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better luck than you deserved,&#8221;
commented Roger crisply. &#8220;Now come on out
for a walk with me. I want you to tell me about
this affair. But not here. It&#8217;s a good thing
that it was I instead of Jimmy who happened
along. There&#8217;d have been a free-for-all fight
sure. Here comes the sergeant, too,&#8221; he added
grimly, as the acting first sergeant stepped from
the stairway into the squad room. &#8220;Wait a
minute. Sit down again and we&#8217;ll see what
Bixton intends to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>With these words, Roger calmly seated himself
on his own cot to await developments, his
eyes trained squarely on Bixton. That injured
individual had also been busy plying a clothes
brush, a fairly good sign, Roger thought, that
he did not intend to carry out his threat. During
the short time that the sergeant remained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
the room an expectant silence prevailed. Like
himself the other rookies present were breathlessly
awaiting the outcome.</p>

<p>Stretched at full length on his cot, Bixton
made no move to unburden himself to the officer.
He watched the latter morosely as he paused to
give an order to one of the men, who promptly
seized his hat and followed him from the room.
As the two disappeared, Roger could not refrain
from casting a challenging glance at the sulker.
Directly he had done it, he was sorry.</p>

<p>Bixton had caught and rightly interpreted it.
Raising himself on his elbow he said fiercely:
&#8220;&#8217;Fraid I was going to tell on him, wasn&#8217;t you?
I&#8217;ll do it yet, if I feel like it. I&#8217;ll fix both you
boobs for this. There&#8217;s other ways beside that.
Before I&#8217;m through, I&#8217;ll see you both fired outa
this camp and those two smart Alecks that run
with you. This camp&#8217;s not big enough to hold
me and you fresh guys at the same time, and
you&#8217;ll pretty soon get wise to it or my name&#8217;s
not Bixton.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X<br />

<small>NO LONGER &#8220;JUST ROOKIES&#8221;</small></h2>


<p>As the September days glided by, Bixton&#8217;s
threat of speedy vengeance bore no apparent
fruit. Whether he was lying in
wait for a good opportunity to discredit the
four Khaki Boys, or whether he was only the
proverbial barking dog that never bites, they
neither knew nor cared. To their great relief,
the story of the fight did not reach the ear of
the acting first sergeant. Thus Ignace escaped
the disgrace of being punished in his very first
week at Camp Sterling.</p>

<p>On hearing an account of the affair from
Ignace himself, Roger was less inclined than
ever to blame him for what had happened. He
did not say so to Ignace, however. Instead, he
sharply pointed out to the crest-fallen pugilist
that two wrongs never made a right. He also
privately warned Bob and Jimmy, who had been
told of the fracas, not to let their sympathies
run away with them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>Impetuous Jimmy, however, found it very
hard to repress openly, to Ignace, his own satisfaction
at the latter&#8217;s recent uprising. He secretly
wished that Ignace <em>had</em> given Bixton a
sound thrashing and &#8220;gotten away with it.&#8221;
Slow of comprehension in some respects, the
Polish boy was not too obtuse to divine Jimmy&#8217;s
attitude toward him. In consequence, he hung
about the latter with a dog-like fidelity that
signally amused Roger and Bob. Devoted as he
was to his three Brothers, Jimmy was rapidly
becoming his idol.</p>

<p>The passing of days saw all four young men
making progress in the business of soldiering.
As has been already stated, Jimmy showed the
most dash and snap in that direction. He took
to military procedure like a duck to water, and
&#8220;went to it&#8221; heart and soul. Easily the most
efficient man in his squad, he was on the road to
a corporalship, though he did not suspect it.
He drilled with the same zest he would have
put into a football game and prided himself
on his prompt ability to execute correctly a new
movement immediately it had been explained to
him. It was the glory rather than the duty of
being a good soldier that most impressed him.</p>

<p>On the other hand, Bob and Roger regarded
it more from the duty angle. This was only
natural, considering that both men had been
obliged, when in civil life, to shift for themselves.
They tackled drill as they would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
wrestled with a new job. It interested but did
not enthrall them. It was a means to an end.
That end meant, to them, Bob in particular,
active service in France. He looked upon
&#8220;Going Over&#8221; as the supreme adventure. If
he survived he intended to come home and write
a book &#8220;that would sell like hot cakes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Iggy&#8217;s noblest aspiration was to do well and
so stay in the same squad with Jimmy and
Bixton. Devotion to the former and spite
against the latter swayed him equally. He knew
that Jimmy was as desirous of his welfare as
Bixton was of his downfall. This double motive
inspired him to good works. Back of it all,
undoubtedly, he was a true patriot. His enlistment
in the Army proved that. For the time
being, however, the glory of being a soldier was
lost in the difficulty of trying to stay one. The
drill sergeant was the most awe-inspiring figure
on his horizon. Long afterward when the four
Brothers had proved their mettle in far-off
France, he had been heard to declare soulfully:
&#8220;Go Over Top no so bad. One drill sergeant
more worse twenty Tops!&#8221;</p>

<p>In spite of his encounter with Bixton, Ignace
was still seized with spells of reciting his rules
aloud. It did not take his companions of the
barracks long to discover the nature of his frequent
fits of mumbling. When it gradually became
noised about in the squad-room that Bob
Dalton had composed them for his bunki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>e&#8217;s
benefit, he was besieged for copies of them.
Though he refused to supply them, he good-naturedly
recited such as he could recall to several
of the men. Very soon hardly a day passed
when he was not asked to give one or more
of them. As a result it was not long before
they achieved the popularity of a topical song
and at least half the occupants of the squad-room
could recite one or more of them. In time
they became circulated throughout the camp
and long after Bob had left Camp Sterling behind
for &#8220;Over There,&#8221; his &#8220;Military Maneuvers
in Rhyme&#8221; were passed on to newcomers
and gleefully quoted.</p>

<p>October saw the four Khaki Boys long since
emerge from the School of the Soldier into the
School of the Squad. They had now mastered
the basic principles of military training and
were beginning to feel a little more like Regulars.
They now knew the Manual of Arms and
had been fully instructed in the use, nomenclature
and care of their rifles. They were no
longer just &#8220;rookies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Their periods of drill had been gradually
lengthened until they were now putting in the
same amount of time as the seasoned men.
From half-past seven in the morning until dismissal
by a sergeant at half-past eleven, they
were kept at work learning soldiering. One
o&#8217;clock Assembly marked the beginning of the
afternoon drill period, which lasted until half-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>past
four with thirty minutes&#8217; intermission before
Retreat.</p>

<p>Thus far none of the quartette had troubled
themselves much concerning &#8220;passes,&#8221; those
magic bits of scribbled paper that meant permission
to quit camp limits for a few brief hours
of civil life. Once or twice they had obtained
leave to spend an evening in Glenwood, a village
about three miles from Camp Sterling.</p>

<p>&#8220;What we ought to do is to all get a pass, go
to Tremont and take in a good show,&#8221; was
Bob&#8217;s opinion one evening as the four boys sat
talking together in barracks. &#8220;We could get
off at noon some Saturday and be back by midnight.
That would give us the afternoon to see
the town, a bang-up supper at a first-class restaurant
and a show afterward. Oh, boy! Oh,
joy! I can just see us doing it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That sounds good to me,&#8221; glowed Jimmy.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve been going slow on the pass business
&#8217;cause I want to ask for one from Saturday until
Monday morning, so that I can go home. Every
letter I get from Mother lately she asks me
when I&#8217;m coming home. But I guess if I&#8217;m good
maybe I can get off with you fellows and get
the pass home, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see. This is Thursday. Why not
make it for day after to-morrow?&#8221; proposed
Bob. &#8220;With pay-day only yesterday we&#8217;ve all
got money to spend. Why let it burn in our
pockets? Use up and earn more&#8217;s my motto.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to take a trip to Tremont,&#8221; nodded
Roger. &#8220;We&#8217;ve all worked good and hard since
we came here. It&#8217;s time for a little harmless
recreation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can count me in,&#8221; readily assured
Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can no go,&#8221; stated Ignace regretfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221; Jimmy demanded. &#8220;What&#8217;s
going to hinder you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no the monies. A little, yes, but no
much. So stay I here. Anyhow, you go. I
very glad for you have the fon. While you way
think I to you,&#8221; Ignace added with a sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;No money! For goodness&#8217; sake, where is
it? You just drew&mdash;&mdash; I beg your pardon,
Iggy.&#8221; Jimmy colored hotly. &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t
have asked such a nosey question. Forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ask all thing you want ask all time.&#8221;
Ignace accompanied this gracious permission
with a sweeping flourish of his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span> &#8220;You are
the Brother. So have you the good right. Firs&#8217;
think I no say nothin&#8217;. Anyhow, now I tell. I
am to poor my mother the bad son for that I
run way. When I home give her all monies no
my father take. Now I here she have the nothin&#8217;
for long time. He my father give only for
the rent an&#8217; the eat. No much the eat. In my
house are the three littles, two sister an&#8217; one
brother. So have I nother brother. He have
sixteen year. Work hard but every week get
only the five dollar, an&#8217; my father take mos&#8217;.
Now have I the pay sen&#8217; all my mother. Only
I keep two dollar. It is enough here, but no
for have the eat, the show, the good time Bob
say. Som&#8217; day go along Tremont. No now. I
am the broke.&#8221; Ignace looked mildly triumphant
at having been able to express himself in
slangy Bob&#8217;s vernacular.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be &#8216;the broke,&#8217; Iggy, but you&#8217;ve
got a solid gold heart!&#8221; exclaimed Bob, his
shrewd black eyes growing soft. &#8220;I call that
mighty white in you. Never you mind, if we
can get the passes you come along with us just
the same. I&#8217;ll do the treating and glad to at
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Count me in on that,&#8221; emphasized Jimmy.
&#8220;My dough is yours, Iggy. You can draw on it
till it gives out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Same here,&#8221; smiled Roger, who had been
signally touched by the broken little tale of
sacrifice.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; The Pole&#8217;s tones indicated stubborn
finality. &#8220;I can no do. Thank. You are
the too good all. I know; un&#8217;erstan&#8217;. I have
for me what you call it, the respet. So mus&#8217; I
the no say an&#8217; stay by the camp. You ask me
more, I no like; feel fonny mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignace&#8217;s characterization of hurt self-respect
as &#8220;fonny mad&#8221; raised a laugh. That, at least,
did not disturb him. He merely grinned and remarked
tranquilly:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span> &#8220;You make the fon one
poor Poley.&#8221;</p>

<p>The plan for a journey into Tremont, having
been duly discussed, it but remained to the three
young men to obtain the desired passes for
Saturday afternoon. Tremont was the only
city of importance within a radius of seventy-five
miles. It lay about twenty miles east of the
camp. Soon after the making of Camp Sterling
a line of automobile busses had sprung up
to do a thriving business between there and
Tremont. There were also many regularly licensed
jitney automobiles that went to and fro
for the accommodation of both soldiers and visitors,
not to mention their own individual profit.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can go to Tremont in one of those Cinderella
pumpkins for seventy-five cents, or we
can give up a plunk apiece and ride in style in a
jit. You pays your money and you takes your
choice,&#8221; declared Bob. At first sight he had
attached the appellation of Cinderella pumpkins
to the big yellow uncomfortable busses operated
by a business concern in Tremont.</p>

<p>&#8220;Me for a regular buzz wagon. I wouldn&#8217;t
wear out my bones bouncing around in one of
those bumpety-bump Noah&#8217;s Arks if I was paid
to ride in it,&#8221; objected Jimmy disdainfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s a quarter more beside Jimmy
Blazes&#8217;s delicate little bones!&#8221; jeered Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you ever ride in one of those rattle-traps?&#8221;
retorted Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, my son, and I don&#8217;t intend to,&#8221; beamed
Bob. &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen other fellows ride in &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />

<small>THE RESULT OF STAYING AWAKE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;So long, Iggy, old top. We&#8217;ll be back
by midnight,&#8221; called out Jimmy
Blazes from the front seat of the automobile
which was to take Roger, Bob and himself
into Tremont for their Wednesday outing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll never know when midnight comes,
Iggy.&#8221; Bob leaned out of the tonneau of the
machine, his black eyes twinkling. &#8220;Better
watch yourself to-night, or you&#8217;ll be dropping
off at eight o&#8217;clock, sitting up straight, and
morning&#8217;ll find you flopped over still in your
uniform. You won&#8217;t have any nice kind brothers
around this evening to shake you awake before
Taps.&#8221; Bob teasingly referred to Ignace&#8217;s
tendency to doze off early in the evening while
sitting on his cot. &#8220;Why not be a hero and
stay awake for once just to see that your little
Buddies get back O. K.?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I,&#8221; assured Ignace with deep decision.
&#8220;Goo&#8217;-bye.&#8221; The automobile now start<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>ing,
he nodded solemnly and raised his hand in a
familiar gesture of farewell which Bob always
called &#8220;Iggy&#8217;s benediction style.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe he will, at that,&#8221; remarked Roger,
as the car rolled down the company street.
&#8220;You shouldn&#8217;t have told him to do it, Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he understood this time that I was only
kidding him,&#8221; was the light rejoinder. &#8220;Look
who&#8217;s here!&#8221; he exclaimed, as the car stopped
at a hail from a waiting group of six soldiers.</p>

<p>Crowded into the tonneau with strangers,
neither Bob nor Roger saw fit to continue the
subject of Ignace. Both were soon exchanging
good-humored commonplaces with their soldier
companions of the ride.</p>

<p>Once fairly outside camp limits, the load of
rollicking soldier boys were soon raising their
voices in a lusty rendering of &#8220;Where Do We
Go From Here?&#8221; With the prospect of an
afternoon and evening of freedom before them,
they were all in high spirits. Traveling a somewhat
rough road, the frequent jolting they met
with whenever the car went over a bump merely
added to their hilarity. An unoffending motorist
ahead of them, driving along in a somewhat
rickety runabout, presently became an object of
marked concern. A running fire of military
commands gleefully shouted out at the swaying
machine as it lurched along soon caused its luckless
driver to speed up and scuttle out of sound
of the derisive calls which greeted him from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
rear. Uncle Sam&#8217;s boys were out for fun and
intended to have it.</p>

<p>An hour&#8217;s ride brought the revelers into Tremont.
Arrived in the heart of the city, which
boasted a population of about one hundred thousand,
Jimmy, Bob and Roger took friendly leave
of their noisy fellow travelers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now where do <em>we</em> go from here?&#8221; asked
Roger, as the trio halted together on a corner
of Center Street, Tremont&#8217;s main thoroughfare,
and looked eagerly about them.</p>

<p>&#8220;To a restaurant for grub,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s fervent
response. &#8220;I know a place where the eats
are O. K. I told you fellows that the first newspaper
job I ever tackled was on a morning
paper in this town. I lived here about three
months. Just long enough to make good on the
paper. Then I beat it back to the big town and
landed with the <em>Chronicle</em>. I know every historic
cobblestone in this lovely burg.&#8221;</p>

<p>As none of the three had stopped for the noon
meal at Camp Sterling, they lost no time in
patronizing the restaurant of Bob&#8217;s choice.</p>

<p>After weeks of uncomplainingly accepting in
their mess kits the wholesome though monotonous
rations of the Army, a real bill of fare to
choose from was a rare treat. In consequence
they lingered long at table and, according to
Jimmy, &#8220;filled up for a week,&#8221; before starting
out to &#8220;see the sights.&#8221; This last consisted of a
stroll through the principal streets, with stops<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
along the way at various shops, there to purchase
a few trifles, such as had caught their
fancy while pausing to stare into attractive
show windows. Then followed a visit to a motion-picture
theater, where a feature photoplay
was going on. From there they drifted into
another &#8220;movie palace,&#8221; and so amused themselves
until supper time. The evening was devoted
to witnessing a &#8220;real show&#8221; at Tremont&#8217;s
largest theater. It was a lively farce comedy
and the boys enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Ignace So Pulinski was putting in
a most lonely afternoon and evening at Camp
Sterling. Temporarily deprived of the lively
society of his Brothers, he was at a loss to know
what to do with himself. Part of the afternoon
he spent in wandering gloomily about camp, frequently
consulting the dollar watch he carried,
in a wistful marking of the slow passing of the
time. Aside from his bunkies, few of the men
in his barrack had ever taken the trouble to
cultivate his acquaintance. During his first
days in camp they had regarded him as &#8220;a
joke,&#8221; privately wondering what three live fellows
like Jimmy, Bob and Roger could see in
&#8220;that slow-poke&#8221; to make a fuss over. After
his wrathful descent upon bullying Bixton, he
had undoubtedly risen in estimation. He had
signally proved his ability to take care of himself.
No longer classed as &#8220;a joke&#8221; he achieved
the title of &#8220;that wild Poley&#8221; and was accorded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a certain amount of grudging respect that made
for civil treatment but little friendliness.</p>

<p>By the time the supper call sounded that evening
Ignace had reached a stage of loneliness
that caused him to sigh gustily as he stood in
line at the counter with his mess kit to receive
his portion of food.</p>

<p>His china-blue eyes roving mournfully over
the long room in search of companionship while
eating, they came to rest on the man Schnitzel.
The latter looked equally lonely, as he arranged
his meal at an unoccupied table at the far end
of the room. Owing to the fact that it was a
half-holiday, the mess hall was minus at least
a fourth of its usual throng. Obeying a sudden
impulse Ignace made his way to where Schnitzel
sat, and asked half-hesitatingly, &#8220;You care I
sit here by you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Help yourself,&#8221; was the laconic response.
Nevertheless the German-American&#8217;s eyes
showed a trace of inquiring surprise at this
sudden invasion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank.&#8221; Ignace carefully set his meat can
and cup on the table, and solemnly seated himself
beside the other.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too much quiet, so is because the many get
the pass,&#8221; ventured the Pole. &#8220;I no like ver&#8217;
well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all the same to me.&#8221; There was a note
of bitterness in the replying voice. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t
any kick coming. I suppose you miss your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
bunkies,&#8221; he added, making an indifferent effort
at civility. &#8220;They&#8217;re a lively bunch of
Sammies.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignace stopped eating and stared fixedly at
his companion. The latter&#8217;s dark, rugged features
wore an expression of melancholy that
woke in him a peculiar feeling of friendliness.
&#8220;Y-e-a,&#8221; he nodded. &#8220;I miss. Them ver&#8217; good
my frens, all. I call my Brothar. You speak
the American good. You have go by American
school?&#8221;</p>

<p>Having never before exchanged a word with
Schnitzel, Ignace had fully expected to hear
the man use broken English.</p>

<p>Schnitzel&#8217;s fork left his hand and clattered
angrily on the bare table. &#8220;Why shouldn&#8217;t I
speak English well?&#8221; he burst forth, scowling
savagely. &#8220;I was born in this country. My
parents came from Germany, but my father&#8217;s
an American citizen. He hates the Kaiser like
poison. I&#8217;m an American, not a Fritzie, as a
lot of fellows here seem to think. If I wasn&#8217;t
I wouldn&#8217;t be in this camp training to go over.
I enlisted because I wanted to fight for my country.
Some people act as if they didn&#8217;t believe
it, though. There&#8217;s been a lot of lies started
about me right in our barrack. I know who to
thank for it, too. I&#8217;ve stood it without saying
a word. But if it goes on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He stopped,
one strong brown hand clenching. &#8220;I was glad
you jumped that hound the other day,&#8221; he con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>tinued
fiercely. &#8220;Wish you&#8217;d hammered him
good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-o!&#8221; Ignace was not too slow of comprehension
to put two and two together. Here it
seemed was a man with whom he had something
in common. &#8220;You see me do him?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I was there that day and saw the
whole thing! I didn&#8217;t blame you. I hate the
sight of him. He bunks next to me, you know.
I wish he didn&#8217;t. But then, what do I care? I
can take care of myself. Don&#8217;t let&#8217;s talk about
him. It makes me sore just to think of him.
Those three fellows you run with are good
chaps. You were lucky to get in with them.
They all treat me fine, though I hardly know
them.&#8221;</p>

<p>Praise of his Brothers caused Ignace to
launch forth into the story of his first meeting
with them, and of all they had done for him.
Schnitzel listened without comment, merely repeating,
&#8220;You were lucky,&#8221; when Ignace had
finished. With that he relapsed into taciturn
silence, hurriedly finished his meal, and with a
brief &#8220;So long&#8221; rose and left Ignace to himself.</p>

<p>The latter, however, was not concerned by
his table-mate&#8217;s sudden relapse into uncommunicativeness.
He watched Schnitzel walk
away, a gleam of interest in his round, childlike
eyes. He would have something pleasant to
tell his Brothers on their return. They would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
be surprised to learn that the &#8220;so quiet fellow
who never talk&#8221; had said so much to him.</p>

<p>His letter to his mother still unwritten, Ignace
decided to begin it directly he had cleansed
and put away his mess kit. Seven o&#8217;clock saw
him established at a desk in the Y. M. C. A.,
laboriously wielding a stubby pencil. This time
he wrote in Polish and at some length. It was
almost nine o&#8217;clock when he finished amid frequent
yawns. Realizing that he was getting
very sleepy, he took a brisk walk up and down
the company street on which his barrack was
situated. He was determined to fight off sleep,
so as to stay awake until his bunkies&#8217; return.</p>

<p>He lingered outside in the crisp night air
until call to quarters drove him reluctantly indoors.
After Taps, however, his struggle began
in earnest.</p>

<p>From the sounds of deep breathing about him
he guessed that he alone was still awake. By
the time that eleven o&#8217;clock had actually arrived
he was sure that it was past twelve, and that his
bunkies had overstayed their leave of absence.
The setting in of this dire conjecture roused
him in earnest. He had now no further need
to fight off sleep.</p>

<p>His face turned anxiously in the direction of
the stairway; he was not aware that across the
squad room a man had noiselessly left his cot
and was slipping along cat-footed toward one
of the three vacant bunks just beyond Ig<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>nace&#8217;s
own. Though he heard no sound, that
inexplicable sense that warns of stealthy approach
wrenched the Pole&#8217;s straying gaze from
the direction of the stairway.</p>

<p>A sudden echoing yell of mingled surprise
and anger was followed by the smack of a bare
fist against flesh. Came a scuffle of feet and a
resounding thump as two bodies hit the floor.
The racket aroused the peacefully dreaming
occupants of the squad room to startled awakening.
As the thumping continued, mingled
with hoarse exclamations, enraged sputterings,
and the thudding impact of blows, a babble of
voices rose on all sides. With it came lights
and an exasperated top sergeant bearing down
upon the combatants with fire in his eye.</p>

<p>He might have been a thousand miles away
so far as the fighters were concerned. They
had now gained their feet, and were engaged
in battle royal.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop it!&#8221; bellowed the sergeant. &#8220;Break
away! Get back to your bunks, both of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Despite his stentorian commands, the fight
went on. Clad only in his undergarments, his
long fair hair wildly tousled, eyes two blue
flames, blood trickling from his nose, Ignace
was a sight to be remembered, as he launched
a powerful blow at Bixton, his hated antagonist.
Bixton looked even worse. The coat of
his pajamas hung on him in shreds. His left
eye was closed, and his nose was bleeding also.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
His face was a livid, infuriate mask against
which the freckles stood out darkly.</p>

<p>The sergeant now took a hand in the fight.
Leaping behind Ignace he wrapped both arms
about the Pole&#8217;s body, and, exerting all his
strength, jerked the belligerent violently backward.
Beginning dimly to realize what was
happening to him, Ignace retained just enough
common sense not to resist, but allowed himself
to be flung unceremoniously down on his cot.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a nice state of affairs,&#8221; lashed out
the sergeant, glaring down at Ignace, who had
now raised himself to a sitting posture. &#8220;Now
you stay where you&#8217;re put. Don&#8217;t you dare
move an inch off that cot.&#8221; With this he
whirled and bore down upon Bixton, who had
been dragged to his own cot by another non-com.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice-looking specimen,&#8221; he blared
forth at Bixton. &#8220;Get those rags off you quick,
and go and wash your face. Move lively. Go
with him, Quinn,&#8221; he directed, turning to the
corporal, who stood at his elbow. &#8220;He&#8217;s not
to be trusted. Get him back here on the jump,
and don&#8217;t let him open his head. The nerve of
two rowdies like that setting the squad room in
an uproar at this time of night! Not another
sound from you, you ruffian,&#8221; he warned Bixton.
&#8220;You&#8217;ll get yours to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It wasn&#8217;t my fault,&#8221; began Bixton hotly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
&#8220;I started to get a drink of water and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue!&#8221; roared the sergeant.
&#8220;See to him, Quinn.&#8221; Turning on his heel the
sergeant took the center of the floor, and issued
a succession of sharp commands that sent the
men to their bunks, and brought order and quiet
out of the humming confusion. Finally satisfied
with the result, he next took Ignace in tow and
marched him off for repairs, sternly refusing
to allow him to offer a word of explanation.
&#8220;You can say what you&#8217;ve got to say at headquarters
to-morrow,&#8221; was his grim ultimatum.</p>

<p>When at five minutes to twelve Roger, Jimmy
and Bob stole quietly into the squad room, it
was apparently wrapped in its usual midnight
silence. Nor were any of the three aware of
the many pairs of bright eyes that marked their
entrance and followed them to their cots.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you asleep, Iggy?&#8221; whispered Jimmy
softly, as, smiling to himself, he bent over the
Pole&#8217;s cot. He was wondering if Ignace had
really taken Bob seriously.</p>

<p>In the darkness an arm reached out and drew
his head down to a level with the Pole&#8217;s own.
Into his ear was breathed the amazing words:
&#8220;I have give Bixton the strong poonch. To-morrow
mebbe no more solder. You no speak
me more now. Morning I tell you.&#8221; The voice
ceased and the grip suddenly relaxed, as Ignace
flopped over on his side with a faint sigh.</p>

<p>Jimmy repressed the amazed ejaculation that
sprang to his lips as he straightened up. Be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>fore
sitting down on his own cot, he slid quietly
over to Roger, who was engaged in removing
his shoes. &#8220;Listen. Iggy&#8217;s done it,&#8221; he whispered.
&#8220;Given Bixton a trimming. He doesn&#8217;t
dare open his head. He&#8217;s in bad. Pass it on to
Bob. I don&#8217;t know what started it, but, oh,
Glory, I wish I&#8217;d been here!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />

<small>AN UNEXPECTED FRIEND AT COURT</small></h2>


<p>During the remainder of the night none
of the four Khaki Boys slept much. The
very nature of Ignace&#8217;s fragmentary information
was calculated to keep his bunkies
awake for a while. Ignace himself tossed restlessly
about on his cot. Though his conscience
did not trouble him, his nose pained
him.</p>

<p>Dropping into fitful slumber just as dawn was
graying in the east, he was cautiously awakened
a little before first call by Roger, who was always
first of the four to open his eyes in the
morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sorry to do it, old man,&#8221; apologized Roger
in a whisper, &#8220;but we mayn&#8217;t have another
chance to talk. Get dressed as quietly as you
can. I&#8217;m going to wake up Jimmy and Bob.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob and Jimmy next interviewed, the quartette
dressed with noiseless speed. Directly
after first call they gathered about Ignace, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in an undertone regaled them with an account
of the fight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to me, Iggy,&#8221; counseled Bob in
low, guarded tones. &#8220;When you get on the
carpet before the K. O. you tell him just what
you told us and stick to it. Don&#8217;t you let Bixton
put it over you. Naturally he&#8217;ll try it. It&#8217;ll be
your word against his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad somebody else didn&#8217;t see him at his
dirty work,&#8221; muttered Jimmy. &#8220;Wish we
hadn&#8217;t gone off to Tremont. Then this wouldn&#8217;t
have happened.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What you should have done, Ignace, was just
to hold onto him and raise an alarm.&#8221; Roger&#8217;s
face indicated troubled sympathy.</p>

<p>&#8220;So think I,&#8221; protested Ignace. &#8220;Get up
quick an&#8217; try. Him no think I am the wake.
Jus&#8217; I catch, him yell; hit me the nose. Then
am I the mad. Hit too; ver&#8217; strong poonch.
So is it the fight.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So is it,&#8221; commented Bob grimly. &#8220;You&#8217;re
in for it, Iggy. All you can do is to speak your
little piece, and take your medicine like a lamb.
You&#8217;re in the Army now. Oh, boy!&#8221; The rueful
intonation of this last brought the flicker
of a smile to three very gloomy faces.</p>

<p>&#8220;Break away!&#8221; warned Jimmy <em>sotto-voce</em>,
as he sighted Sergeant Dexter bearing down
upon them.</p>

<p>As Roger had feared, the sergeant was on the
trail of the belligerents, neither of whom were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
to be allowed to mingle with their comrades,
pending the action of the commanding officer, to
whom he had already sent a written report of
the disturbance.</p>

<p>Following one o&#8217;clock Assembly that day,
came the dread summons that saw both Ignace
and Bixton dropped out of ranks and marched
off to headquarters under guard, there to give
an account of themselves to that awe-inspiring
person, the K. O., which is Army vernacular for
the commanding officer. It was a highly uncomfortable
moment for both when they were
brought into the presence of a most austere-faced
commandant, whose penetrating blue eyes
pierced them through and through, as they came
to attention before his desk.</p>

<p>With him was Sergeant Dexter, who eyed the
two with an expression of profound disgust.
The sergeant was feeling decidedly sore over
the whole affair. It put him in an unpleasant
light. Having stared the culprits fairly out of
countenance, Major Stearns proceeded, with due
deliberation, to pick up the report from his desk,
reading it aloud in a dry, hard tone that fully
indicated his great displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a full report of what occurred last
night?&#8221; he asked, turning to Sergeant Dexter.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is, sir,&#8221; replied the sergeant, saluting.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name? What have you to say
for yourself?&#8221; he next rapped out severely, addressing
Bixton. The man&#8217;s left eye showed all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
too plainly the result of that scrimmage in the
dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bixton, sir. What happened last night was
not my fault, sir,&#8221; returned Bixton, almost defiantly.
&#8220;A little after eleven o&#8217;clock I woke
up and found I was thirsty. I left my cot to
get a drink of water. I crossed the room as
quiet as I could, and started down the squad
room. I stumbled a little in the dark and
stopped for a minute. Next thing I knew a man
had jumped on me and was trying to hit me.
It surprised me so I yelled right out. He kept
on hitting me, so I had to defend myself
and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no the trut&#8217;,&#8221; came the angry contradiction.
Ignace glared righteous indignation
at his traducer. &#8220;Never I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Silence!&#8221; thundered the K. O. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you
dare speak until you&#8217;re told to talk!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8217;Scuse,&#8221; muttered Ignace, too utterly
abashed by the rebuke to be soldier-like.</p>

<p>&#8220;You state,&#8221; the Major resumed his inquiry,
&#8220;that this man here attacked you last night
in the dark without cause?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph! Have you ever before had any
trouble with him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Once before, sir.&#8221; A baleful gleam of
triumph shot into the man&#8217;s pale eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;When and where? Tell me about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One day quite a while ago he was talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
loud in barracks when I was trying to rest.
I asked him to stop it, and he wouldn&#8217;t pay any
attention. Then I asked him again to stop making
so much noise, and he jumped on me just the
same as he did last night. He got me down and
would have half-killed me if one of the fellows
he runs with hadn&#8217;t come in and pulled him
off. As soon as I knew last night who was
fighting me I wasn&#8217;t surprised any more. I
knew he&#8217;d been laying for me and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That will do.&#8221; The major cut him off
sharply.</p>

<p>Fixing a severe glance on Sergeant Dexter
he asked, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you make a report of
this first fight between these two men?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew nothing about it,&#8221; was the chagrined
answer. &#8220;I was certainly <em>not</em> in the barrack
when it occurred.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; came the dry repetition. &#8220;You
seem to be hunting for trouble, my man,&#8221; was
the commanding officer&#8217;s grim opinion, as he
looked poor Ignace sternly over. &#8220;If you&#8217;ve
anything to say, I&#8217;ll hear it.&#8221; The tone indicated
that more than enough had already been
said. &#8220;What&#8217;s your name? Speak up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignace drew a deep, sighing breath. Raising
his head with a proud little air, which he had
unconsciously borrowed from Jimmy, he said,
with slow dignity:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span> &#8220;I am one a Pole, Ignace
Pulinski, sir. I am no the liar, sir. Now say
I the trut&#8217; all. You no believe, I can no help.&#8221;
Quite unemotionally, and with frequent groping
for a word that eluded him, Ignace proceeded
in his broken speech to give a detailed
account of Bixton&#8217;s repeated churlish conduct
toward himself since he had first encountered
him in Company E&#8217;s barrack. Neither did the
K. O. interrupt him, but allowed him to go on
talking, his keen eyes never leaving the Polish
boy&#8217;s stolid face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yeserday my three Brothar get the pass,&#8221;
pursued Ignace doggedly. &#8220;Then I all &#8217;lone.
Bob say, &#8216;you stay wake we come back.&#8217; I say,
&#8216;So will I.&#8217; Taps him come, I ver&#8217; sleepy, but
no go sleep. So wait I an&#8217; watch. After while
think now is mid the night. My Brothar no yet
come. I look to the stair, then, know I no why,
look round. I see this man&mdash;so.&#8221; Ignace
leaned forward to illustrate. &#8220;He have the
hand reach out the rack Jimmy, my ver&#8217; bes&#8217;
Brothar. I think he go steal something. Once
we write the lettar. Leave on the shelf Jimmy.
In morning no lettar. So las&#8217; night think him
mebbe t&#8217;ief. I think catch, keep till sergeant
come. Then him yell an&#8217; hit me the nose. So
am I the mad. Hit, too; ver&#8217; strong poonch.
So is it the fight,&#8221; ended Ignace placidly, using
the precise words in which he had recounted the
fray to his bunkies.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a big lie from beginning to end!
He&#8217;s trying to save his own face.&#8221; This time
it was Bixton who forgot himself. His face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
aflame, he turned menacingly upon his accuser.
&#8220;You dirty, foreign trash&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold your tongue! Such language is unbecoming
enough in itself, let alone in the presence
of your commanding officer.&#8221; The probing
eyes of the commandant grew steely, his
jaws came together with a snap on the last
word. &#8220;The stories of you two men don&#8217;t
agree in the least, except on one point,&#8221; he continued
harshly. &#8220;You are both guilty of
brawling and thus disgracing the Service. Sergeant&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;
Still standing at rigid attention,
the non-com. tried to look even more attentive.
&#8220;Bring the man you say knows something of
this affair from the other room.&#8221;</p>

<p>Smartly saluting, the sergeant wheeled and
stepped to the door of an inner room. Flinging
it open he disappeared, to return almost instantly
with a soldier, whose dark, rugged face
was set in purposeful lines.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the man, sir,&#8221; reported the sergeant.</p>

<p>Momentary consternation showed itself in
Bixton&#8217;s face as he viewed the unexpected witness;
then a sneer played about his lips. Ignace,
however, stared at the newcomer in blank,
absolute wonder. The sergeant&#8217;s report, read
out by the K. O., had contained nothing about
this third party, who, nevertheless, it seemed,
had something to say about last night&#8217;s disturbance.
Now the Pole listened with strained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
attention as Private Schnitzel, the man whose
acquaintance he had made only yesterday, made
prompt replies to the major&#8217;s preliminary questions.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what you saw last night,&#8221; commanded
the K. O.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was awake and saw Bixton leave his cot
last night, sir. He crossed the room and
stopped, as well as I could see in the dim light,
in front of the vacant cots that belong to the
men that were away. I saw him reach out his
hand. Then I heard him yell and knew someone
had caught hold of him. I knew it must be
Pulinski who had grabbed him, because he must
have thought just as I did that Bixton was up
to something crooked.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never mind what you thought,&#8221; frowned
the major. &#8220;Is that all you saw? You are
holding nothing back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all I saw, sir. I have told you everything
I knew about <em>last night</em>, sir, except that I
saw the fight and all that happened afterward
when the sergeant came.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you know concerning the trouble
between these two men previous to this disgraceful
affair?&#8221; The K. O. had caught the
slight stress laid on Schnitzel&#8217;s words, &#8220;last
night.&#8221; &#8220;Were you in the squad room when
the first brawl between them took place?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Give me an impartial account of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Schnitzel complied with a terse recital of the
occurrence, which in every detail corroborated
the statements which Ignace had made.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you ready to take solemn oath, if necessary,
that what you have just stated is absolutely
true in every respect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very good. That will be all for the present.
You may go.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saluting, Schnitzel wheeled and walked
briskly from the room.</p>

<p>An oppressive silence fell as the sound of his
retreating footfalls died out, during which the
K. O. coldly scrutinized the pair before him.
When at last he spoke, he addressed himself to
Bixton.</p>

<p>&#8220;According to the testimony of two men, you
were behaving in a suspicious manner when
Pulinski attacked you. If you were on your
way to get a drink of water, why did you stop
to prowl about another man&#8217;s cot?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t stop on purpose, sir,&#8221; denied Bixton.
&#8220;I stumbled and nearly fell. In the dark
it might have looked different to those two men,
though.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d advise you to carry yourself so straight
hereafter that what you do won&#8217;t &#8216;look different&#8217;
to any man in your barrack,&#8221; was the
sarcastic retort. &#8220;Mind your own business,
and keep to your own side of the squad room.</p>

<p>&#8220;As for you,&#8221; he stared hard at Ignace,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
&#8220;keep your too-ready fists to yourself. A
rowdy who can&#8217;t control himself isn&#8217;t fit to be
a soldier. Loss of self-control in war time has
put more than one man against a blank wall,
facing a firing squad. If you see a man acting
in what you think is a suspicious manner, report
him to your sergeant. Don&#8217;t fly at him like a
savage and start to pummel him. Leave discipline
to your officers. That&#8217;s what they&#8217;re here
for.</p>

<p>&#8220;You two men are both guilty of disgraceful
and disorderly conduct. If you&#8217;re ever brought
on the carpet again for fighting or misbehavior
in barracks it will go hard with you. You will
be confined to your company street for thirty
days, without privileges and with extra fatigue.
If that doesn&#8217;t teach you soldierly behavior,
we have stronger methods of dealing with such
ruffians as you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Having delivered himself of a few further
biting remarks relative to his highly uncomplimentary
opinion of both men, the K. O. ordered
them back to barracks, instructing the sergeant
to keep a close watch on them, and see that his
orders regarding them went into instant effect.</p>

<p>To Ignace it seemed unbelievable that he
should be returning to barracks. He had fully
expected to land in the guard-house for at least
twenty days. He was divided between humiliation
at the rebuke he had just received, and
dazed happiness at the thought of again being<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with his Brothers. He was also deeply grateful
to Schnitzel, whom he fully realized had
tried to befriend him.</p>

<p>Though the commanding officer had reprimanded
both himself and Bixton with impartial
severity, Ignace could not know that of the two
he had made a far better impression on the
&#8220;ver&#8217; cross major.&#8221; Behind Major Stearns&#8217;
impassive features had lurked a certain sympathy
for the man who had been too hasty with
his fists in the protection of his friend&#8217;s property.
The K. O. was of the private opinion that
whereas Ignace had told the truth, Bixton had
lied. A keen student of human nature, he had
arrived at a fairly correct estimate of the latter.
The testimony against him had been too
vague, however, on which to hold him for any
charge other than that of disorderly conduct.
He had, accordingly, been obliged to consider
the two combatants as equally guilty. He was
strongly of the belief, however, that Bixton
would bear watching, and made mental note that
he would instruct Sergeant Dexter to keep a
special lookout in that direction.</p>

<p>Bixton&#8217;s face was not good to see as he returned
to barracks. He was consumed with a
black and unreasoning rage against the world
in general. Most of all he hated Schnitzel.
Schnitzel had tried to &#8220;queer&#8221; him. Well,
he had failed. Now he, Bixton, would never rest
until he &#8220;got even&#8221; with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span> &#8220;nosey tattle-tale.&#8221;
He would &#8220;queer&#8221; Schnitzel no matter
how long it took him. When he was through,
Schnitzel would find himself in for something
worse than a &#8220;bawling-out&#8221; from the K. O.,
extra fatigue and thirty days&#8217; loss of liberty and
privileges.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />

<small>A CORPORAL AT LAST</small></h2>


<p>Returned from drill that afternoon,
Bob, Jimmy and Roger were jubilant to
learn that Ignace had escaped the guard-house.
They were also greatly surprised, and
not a little pleased to hear from him of the
sturdy stand Schnitzel had taken in his behalf.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was white in Schnitzel to do that,&#8221;
lauded Jimmy. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet it helped some, even if
he couldn&#8217;t say he&#8217;d really seen Bixton do anything
crooked. I&#8217;d just like to know why that
sneak was fishing around my cot. After my
suitcase, maybe. But what would he want that&#8217;s
in there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most any little thing that he didn&#8217;t happen
to have and took a fancy to,&#8221; shrugged Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely he wanted to get at your side of
the rack and do some mischief to your clothing,&#8221;
was Roger&#8217;s sage opinion. &#8220;Slash your
overcoat or cut all the buttons off it, or do something
of that sort. I&#8217;ve heard that he has plenty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
of money to spend, and that he gets lots of stuff
from home. He was out to do something malicious
rather than steal. He&#8217;s the kind of a
man that holds a grudge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s something in that,&#8221; nodded Bob
reflectively. &#8220;Well, he&#8217;s canned for a while,
anyhow. He&#8217;ll have to lie low and mind his
p&#8217;s and q&#8217;s. Hope he doesn&#8217;t try later to take
his spite out on Schnitzel. I guess Schnitzel&#8217;s
not afraid of him, though. What he did for
Iggy proves that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Schnitzel&#8217;s too much of a man to let a sneak
like Bixton get his goat,&#8221; asserted Jimmy.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll plod along just as he&#8217;s done before and
pretend not to notice that yellow cur. We ought
to do something to show Schnitzel that we think
he&#8217;s O. K. I&#8217;ve never had much to say to him
&#8217;cause I&#8217;ve always thought he&#8217;d rather be let
alone. Now I&#8217;m going to make a stab at getting
acquainted with him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So stab I, too,&#8221; agreed Ignace promptly,
which raised a laugh at his expense.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve done enough &#8216;stabbing&#8217; to hold you
for a while.&#8221; The smile faded from Jimmy&#8217;s
lips. &#8220;Do you know that your thirty days&#8217;ll
be up just one day after Thanksgiving? You&#8217;ve
given the &#8216;strong poonch&#8217; to a plan of mine. I
wanted all three of you fellows to go home with
me for Thanksgiving. I&#8217;d already fixed it up
with Mother. Now you&#8217;ve gone and queered
yourself on my account, so I guess we&#8217;d all bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>ter
stay here for Thanksgiving and keep you
company.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ignace eyed Jimmy wistfully. &#8220;No,&#8221; he announced
with heroic positiveness, &#8220;never you
stay here for the Thankgivin&#8217;. You go home,
along Bob and Roger. You stay here, I am the
mad. No speak you, no look you, no nothin&#8217;.
I am no the pig. You go by Jimmy?&#8221; he demanded
anxiously of Roger and Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is so sudden,&#8221; murmured Bob. &#8220;It
takes my breath.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You and Jimmy will have to settle it between
you, Iggy,&#8221; laughed Roger. &#8220;It&#8217;s not
up to Bob and me to choose. All I have to say
is that it&#8217;s mighty fine in you and your folks,
Blazes, to want us with you for our Thanksgiving
furlough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly is,&#8221; Bob agreed warmly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see?&#8221; Ignace turned triumphantly to
Jimmy. &#8220;Bob and Roger want go by your
house. So is it.&#8221; Having made up his mind
on this important point, Ignace was firm.</p>

<p>True to his word, that very evening Jimmy
sought out Schnitzel and invited him to go for
a stroll about the camp, in company with Bob
and Roger. The man&#8217;s gloomy face brightened
perceptibly as he somewhat hesitatingly rose
from his cot, laid aside a book he had been reading,
and followed Jimmy to the stairs, where
his two friends stood waiting. Due to his reticent,
stand-offish manner, it was the first invita<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>tion
of the kind he had received since his arrival
at Camp Sterling.</p>

<p>Bixton&#8217;s malicious intimations against him
had done far less to ostracize him than had his
own hurt pride. Keenly sensitive of his German
parentage, the first whisper against his loyalty
to the Flag had caused him to retreat into his
shell.</p>

<p>It is said that out of evil some good must
eventually come. The disturbance between Ignace
and Bixton resulted at least in awakening
in the minds of Iggy&#8217;s bunkies a genuine interest
in Schnitzel, which was one day to prove his
salvation. Though he responded rather shyly
to their kindly overtures, he made a favorable
impression on all three, and, in his reserved
fashion, soon grew to be on fairly friendly terms
with them. With Ignace he appeared to be even
a trifle more at ease. He had not forgotten the
little incident of the mess hall. Ignace had come
to him at a moment when he most needed companionship.
That he was grateful he had summarily
proved.</p>

<p>Meanwhile both participants in the fight were
feeling the effects of their breach of good conduct.
Added to their daily routine of drill was
hard work and plenty of it, not to mention the
loss of all privileges, confinement to the company
street, and the too-searching eyes of the
top sergeant keeping tab on their movements.</p>

<p>Ignace did not so much mind the hard work.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
He had never been used to anything else. Loss
of privileges and confinement to the company
street were his chief crosses. Though November
was fast slipping away, the weather had
remained mild. There had been plenty of sunshine
and little rain. In consequence, his
Brothers spent much of their leisure time out-of-doors,
and it grieved Ignace not a little not
to be in a position to accompany them on their
frequent jaunts about the camp, or on brief
expeditions to Glenwood.</p>

<p>Bixton, on the contrary, resented far more
than loss of privileges and confinement to company
street, the amount of hard work he was
made to perform. He disdainfully regarded
the various camp labors imposed upon him as
servant&#8217;s tasks. Brought up in idleness by a
too-adoring widowed mother, his enlistment had
come about as the result of a disagreement with
her over money.</p>

<p>From the moment in which he had begun to
realize that the Army had &#8220;got&#8221; him, he had
become at heart a slacker. He had been careful
not to let it be suspected, however, among
the men in his barrack.</p>

<p>Spiteful by nature, he was ready to make
any man whom he did not like an escape-valve
for his pent-up malice against the military. He
had picked Schnitzel as his first victim, but
without any special success. The German-American
had refused to quarrel with him or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
notice his petty attempts to torment him. He
had accordingly started upon Ignace, thereby
drawing down upon himself Jimmy&#8217;s hearty dislike,
which he had returned with equal intensity.
As Roger had surmised, Bixton&#8217;s stealthy trip
across the squad room had to do with certain
dark designs on Jimmy&#8217;s equipment, best
known to the author of them. The drubbing
Ignace had given him, followed by the summons
before the K. O., died into insignificance beside
the unexpected move Schnitzel had made against
him. He now had but one object in life: to &#8220;get
even&#8221; with &#8220;that German snake.&#8221;</p>

<p>If Franz Schnitzel suspected Bixton of harboring
plans for revenge, he kept it to himself.
When in company with the four Brothers, Bixton&#8217;s
name seldom crossed his lips. Warned
by the impetuous Jimmy to &#8220;look out for
that hound,&#8221; he merely replied, &#8220;I&#8217;m not afraid
of him.&#8221; No one save himself knew of the alert
watch he kept on himself and his belongings.
If Bixton tried to &#8220;put anything over on him,&#8221;
he proposed to be ready to hold his own.</p>

<p>With the middle of November came the first
signs of approaching winter. Light falls of
snow blanketed the camp and the nights grew
cold. Thanks to the beneficent efforts of that
indefatigable band of Army welfare workers,
the Red Cross, Uncle Sam&#8217;s boys at Camp Sterling
were the grateful recipients of extra quilts,
sweaters, knitted wristlets and warm under-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>clothing.
Among the more fortunately-situated
soldiers, such as Jimmy Blaise, who were already
well supplied with every comfort, these
unexpected gifts were passed on by them to
more needy comrades. Due to delay in the turning
on of steam heat in the barracks, these extra
quilts were particularly welcome. After the
hard day&#8217;s routine of outdoor drill, the tired
soldier boys had on more than one night found
their allotted bed covers insufficient against the
snapping cold. It was the first real discomfort
they had encountered since their enlistment, and
the majority of the camp contingent accepted
it in the spirit of true veterans.</p>

<p>Veterans they were fast becoming. All traces
of the rookie had long since vanished. They
had acquired the erect carriage and long, purposeful
stride that indelibly marks a man the
world over as belonging or having once belonged
to the military. Each day saw them engaged
in learning or perfecting some necessary
part of the soldier&#8217;s trade. Strenuous practice
hikes about camp, bayonet drills, trench instruction,
target practice, together with the
thousand and one details of military training,
now entered into their scheme of life.</p>

<p>Among them all, there was no finer example
than Jimmy Blaise of what military training
will do for a young man. He was not only a
joy to look at, so far as soldierly bearing went.
He was also verifying the early promise he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
shown of inevitably rising from the lowly private
to the rank of a non-commissioned officer.
Off duty and among his bunkies he was the
same easy-going Jimmy. On duty he was a man
who regarded the Service as a religion and lived
up to it devotedly. Whatever he was ordered
to do he did, with an intelligence and finish
which marked him as one who keenly <em>felt</em> his
responsibility.</p>

<p>No one except himself was greatly surprised
when, just a week before Thanksgiving, he received
a warrant from Washington, which signified
that his appointment to a corporalship
had been approved by Major Sterns, his commanding
officer. So far as friendliness can be
demonstrated in the Army between a commissioned
officer and an enlisted man, Jimmy stood
well in the estimation of the major.</p>

<p>Strangely enough it was his knowledge of
automobiles which had brought him first notice
from the commanding officer. The removal of
a man, who had acted as the major&#8217;s chauffeur,
to another training camp had caused the K. O.
to look about him for a substitute. It having
reached the ears of Sergeant Dexter that
&#8220;Blaise owned a car and knew a lot about buzz
wagons,&#8221; he had promptly acquainted the
major with the fact. The result was that Jimmy
was detailed one Sunday afternoon to drive the
K. O. into Tremont. This trip was the first of
other similar expeditions in the major&#8217;s service.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
His delight in them was scarcely greater than
that of his bunkies. Though Bob and Roger
teasingly accused him of &#8220;being raised a pet&#8221;
and warned him against &#8220;getting the big head,&#8221;
they were unenviously glad of his good luck.</p>

<p>So it was that when, on the momentous afternoon
of his rise from the ranks, he proudly confided
to them the great news, they received it
with a jubilation second only to his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re hiking right along on the Glory
Road, old man,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s hearty congratulation
as he wrung Jimmy&#8217;s hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mebbe soon top sergeant,&#8221; averred Ignace
hopefully, his solemn face wreathed with
smiles.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you&#8217;ll lose your bunkie, Iggy,&#8221; teased
Bob. &#8220;Top sergeants are rare, exclusive birds,
you know. They roost on the roof of the barracks
with their heads in the air. They have
their uses, though. They stop fights, quell
frays and disorders and&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, chop it,&#8221; cut in Jimmy in sheepish protest.
&#8220;The war&#8217;ll be over long before I ever
get that far. You fellows will probably be corporals,
before long. I hope so. I&#8217;m not so
much.&#8221; It was Jimmy&#8217;s favorite summing-up
of himself. &#8220;Course I&#8217;m glad it happened. I
guess it was just luck, though. Anyway, I&#8217;m
going to be a bully good corp. if I can. No
half-way business about it. I don&#8217;t expect to
go any higher in a hurry. I wouldn&#8217;t care to,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
unless I could take you fellows along with me.
I&#8217;d rather be one of the four Brothers than a
rare bird that roosts on top of the barracks.
I&#8217;d rather stay with the gang and see what
happens.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />

<small>ADVENTURE</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the program for to-morrow
afternoon?&#8221; demanded Jimmy
Blaise of his bunkies. It was Friday
evening and the four Khaki Boys had finished
their supper and were returning to barracks
from the mess hall.</p>

<p>&#8220;Most any old thing except hanging around
camp all Saturday afternoon,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s fervent
response. &#8220;Nothing that takes much
dough, though. I&#8217;m saving my coin for Thanksgiving
and the big town.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, too,&#8221; nodded Roger. &#8220;Still I
wouldn&#8217;t mind spending a dollar or so down in
Glenwood to-morrow afternoon. A fellow told
me about a bazaar that&#8217;s to be held there for
the benefit of the Red Cross. We might take
that in. The Red Cross has been mighty good
to us. I guess it wouldn&#8217;t hurt us to help the
bazaar along a little.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll do my bit,&#8221; agreed Jimmy cheerfully.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
&#8220;What&#8217;s a few plunks to Blazes? He&#8217;s going
home next Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can no go,&#8221; stated Ignace automatically.
He had said it so many times during the past
month that it now fell from his lips like an
oft-recited lesson.</p>

<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;ve heard you remark before,&#8221; commented
Bob lightly. &#8220;Never mind, Iggy, you&#8217;ll
soon be over your troubles. Then we&#8217;ll give
you a bang-up blow-out in Tremont to make up
for the unhappy past.&#8221; Pausing in the middle
of the company street Bob raised his meat can
on high and exclaimed dramatically, &#8220;One
week from to-day, Ignace So Pulinski, and you
shall walk forth under the open sky and from
the narrow confines of the company street,
shouting &#8216;Free at last! The past is gone
and cannot be recalled but the glorious future&mdash;&mdash;&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, som&#8217; one see, so say I am the crazy,&#8221;
giggled Ignace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come along before someone runs <em>you</em> in for
a nut,&#8221; warned Jimmy, seizing Bob by the arm.
&#8220;Here comes a shave-tail. Try that lingo on
him and see what he says.&#8221; By &#8220;shave-tail&#8221;
Jimmy referred in Army slang to a &#8220;second
lieutenant.&#8221;</p>

<p>Four hands went up into prompt action as
the lieutenant came within saluting range and
passed on.</p>

<p>&#8220;He just missed my oration,&#8221; deplored Bob.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Run after him and tell him about it,&#8221;
laughed Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some other time. I&#8217;ve got to attend a sewing-bee
at barracks and I can&#8217;t play along the
way. I&#8217;ve a date with a needle and thread and
a few buttons.&#8221;</p>

<p class="noindent">caroled Bob. &#8220;That&#8217;s me; Bobby, the Beautiful
Seamstress, or Sewing on Buttons Against
Heavy Odds. You certainly learn a lot of useful
trades in the Army.&#8221;</p>

<p>Returned to barracks, all four soon busied
themselves in the going over of their effects.
Saturday morning meant the weekly inspection
of their cots and equipment by an officer from
the regimental hospital, whose practiced eyes
missed nothing in the way of defects. Thus far
no one of them had failed to be in readiness for
him. Nor did they intend that he should find
anything to criticize.</p>

<p>Saturday dawned clear and sunny, with only
a suspicion of frost in the bracing air. Having
obtained leave of absence for the afternoon, the
three bunkies started for Glenwood directly
after the noon mess, Ignace accompanying them
as far as the end of the company street.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>Arrived at the main street of the drowsy
little town, their first move was to find the
building which held the Red Cross bazaar.</p>

<p>On entering, the three Khaki Boys found the
place already well filled with Glenwood civilians
and soldiers from Camp Sterling. For an hour
or so they amused themselves strolling about
the big room, lined on three sides with gaily
decorated booths, each with its own attraction
in the way of salable commodities. After
conscientiously doing their bit in the way of
purchasing a number of articles that caught
their fancy, they left the bazaar and wandered
on down the street to a bowling alley.</p>

<p>It was four o&#8217;clock when they emerged, each
well pleased with the score he had run up.
After a brief stop at a drug store soda fountain
for hot chocolate, Bob was of the opinion that
camp was almost as exciting as Glenwood and
that they had better be beating it up the road.</p>

<p>Frequent side-stepping to allow the passing
of jitneys to and from camp finally moved Bob
to propose impatiently, &#8220;Let&#8217;s get off this turnpike
and hit it up across the fields. It may be
a little bit roundabout but we&#8217;ve lots of time to
get back to camp.&#8221;</p>

<p>Roger and Jimmy agreeing, the trio left the
highway, leaping a stump fence and striking off
across a meadow, the withered grass of which
still showed patches of green. Crossing it they
went on to another field, which continued level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
for a little way, then sloped gradually downward.
Coming to the point where the descent
began, three voices were suddenly raised in a
concerted shout. Their eyes had simultaneously
spied at the foot of the slope that which
had evoked the outcry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come on!&#8221; yelled Jimmy, breaking into a
run. &#8220;It&#8217;s an aeroplane. Looks as though it
had flopped. Maybe someone&#8217;s hurt or killed!&#8221;</p>

<p>With a shout, a figure emerged from behind
the fuselage of the quiescent plane and stood
still, gazing straight at the rapidly advancing
trio.</p>

<p>&#8220;One man alive!&#8221; yelled Bob. &#8220;Hope he&#8217;s
the whole show! Hey there! Anybody hurt?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nope,&#8221; came the cheerful hail. &#8220;Old
Auntie&#8217;s just wanted to take a rest. She takes
&#8217;em once in a while. She&#8217;s all right now. We
were getting ready to go up when we heard you
yell.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this reassuring information the speaker
stepped forward, halting a few paces from the
newcomers. Close survey of him showed a grinning,
boyish face, looking out from a close-fitting
hood. It was lighted by two dancing blue
eyes, bluer by reason of their heavily marked
brows and thick black lashes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee!&#8221; exploded Jimmy. &#8220;We thought it
was a sure-enough smash-up! Some plane
you&#8217;ve got there. Mind if we take a look&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>He broke off abruptly, his gray eyes widen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>ing.
From the elevator of the motionless plane
a stooping figure suddenly straightened up.
For an instant Jimmy was under the impression
that he was seeing double. &#8220;Why&mdash;what&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; he
gasped, as he stared stupidly at this second
youth, so identically like the first, even to his
wide grin.</p>

<p>&#8220;Twins!&#8221; Bob&#8217;s quick brain had instantly
grasped the situation. &#8220;Well, I&#8217;ll be jiggered!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How did you guess it?&#8221; laughed the youth
they had first addressed. &#8220;You don&#8217;t think we
look alike, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not enough so that I&#8217;d ever be able to tell
you apart,&#8221; retorted Bob, his black eyes twinkling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that&#8217;s easy enough when you know us,&#8221;
was the jesting assurance of the other twin.
&#8220;We never have any trouble about it ourselves.
I wouldn&#8217;t have to be a detective to spot where
you fellows live. How&#8217;s Camp Sterling, anyway?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s there yet. At least, it was still there at
one o&#8217;clock.&#8221; Bob&#8217;s voice quivered with amusement.
His face betrayed a lively curiosity,
which was plainly reflected on the features of
his companions. To suddenly come upon an
aeroplane taking a rest in a hollow and presided
over by a couple of youngsters, so identical
in every respect, even to a wide, good-natured
grin, was adventure, to say the least.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV<br />

<small>THE TWINKLE TWINS</small></h2>


<p>Unable to restrain his own wonder,
Jimmy burst forth impulsively, &#8220;Say,
where did you two come from? You
don&#8217;t belong around here, do you? That&#8217;s the
first plane I&#8217;ve seen since we struck Camp
Sterling and said &#8216;I do.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We live about thirty-five miles from here,
out in the country. We&#8217;re the Twinkleton
Twins,&#8221; came the smiling answer. &#8220;That&#8217;s no
joke. The name, I mean.&#8221; He had noted
Jimmy&#8217;s involuntary half-frown. &#8220;We&#8217;re
Twinkletons all right. John and Gerald. I&#8217;m
John and he&#8217;s Gerald. Only we get Jack and
Jerry, or the Twinkle Twins, mostly. Oh, it&#8217;s
great to have a double!&#8221; he added drolly, his
Cheshire grin reappearing.</p>

<p>&#8220;It sure is,&#8221; echoed his brother, duplicating
the wide smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, Twinkle Twins, we&#8217;re glad to know
you.&#8221; Bob held out his hand. &#8220;I&#8217;m Bob Dal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>ton,
and these two Sammys are Roger Barlow
and Jimmy Blaise&mdash;Blazes, I mean.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Jimmy Blazes! That&#8217;s a hot name,&#8221; commented
the twin who had first spoken, as he
shook hands with Roger and Jimmy. &#8220;Pretty
near as good as Twinkle Twins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty near,&#8221; agreed Jimmy with a heartiness
that bespoke lively approbation of the
merry-faced strangers. His glance roving over
the aeroplane, he added: &#8220;It must be great
sport to sail around in that. Beats a buzz-buggy
all hollow!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s us. We have a racer, but we haven&#8217;t
used it much since we got Auntie, here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Auntie!&#8221; repeated Roger in an amused
tone. Thus far he had let Bob and Jimmy do
the talking. &#8220;Talk about names! That&#8217;s a
funny one for an aeroplane.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s an Antoinette, but we call her Auntie
&#8217;cause it&#8217;s quicker. She&#8217;s a near and dear
relative. See?&#8221; explained Jack Twinkleton.
&#8220;She has a history, too. You&#8217;d never guess
who used to own her, so I&#8217;ll tell you. You&#8217;ve
heard of Emile Voissard, haven&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, rather!&#8221; exclaimed Bob. &#8220;He&#8217;s the
wonderman they call the &#8216;Flying Terror of
France.&#8217; I&#8217;ve seen a lot of pictures of him.
He&#8217;s done great work in the air for the Allies.
Never expected to meet anyone who knew him,
though.&#8221; Bob&#8217;s features registered profound
admiration.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s a cousin of ours,&#8221; proudly informed
Jerry. &#8220;Our mother was a Voissard. We&#8217;re
half French and the rest English. This plane
is a back number. Emile was over here with
it before the war began, giving exhibition
flights. We lived in California then. He used
it a lot out there. About the time he got ready
to throw it on the scrap heap we made him give
it to us. The engine was on the blink, etc., and
he said it was a safe proposition for us, because
we&#8217;d never be able to do more than run it over
the ground. We tinkered at the engine a long
while, but we finally made her go, and Auntie&#8217;s
been using her wings more or less ever since.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We only came east last July. We were in
Stanford University,&#8221; chimed in Jack. &#8220;We&#8217;re
a pair of &#8216;orfin&#8217; twins. Used to spend our summers
with an aunt in California, but she
couldn&#8217;t stand us after we got the flying habit.
We got on her nerves. So she shipped us and
Auntie out here to an uncle of ours. It suited
us, though. He has a fine country place. He&#8217;s
a chemist and spends most of his time hanging
out in his laboratory. Doesn&#8217;t care much what
we do as long as we let him alone. He&#8217;s a sort
of hermit and sticks off by himself. Now, come
on. Jerry and I&#8217;ll show you around. Guess
you&#8217;ve heard enough about us.&#8221;</p>

<p>With this the Twinkle Twins conducted a
most willing trio about and up into the aeroplane,
keeping up a running fire of explana<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>tion
as they pointed out its parts and their uses.
From the well-patched taut canvas wings to the
once almost useless engine, which they had successfully
repaired, they had demonstrated a
skill and ingenuity that aroused the Khaki Boys
to enthusiastic admiration. They were in the
midst of a most interesting experience, consequently
they asked questions to the stage of
being ashamed to quiz further these affable
new acquaintances.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s risky when your engine stops all of a
sudden. Is that what happened to you this
afternoon?&#8221; Jimmy ventured a last query.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yep,&#8221; nodded Jack. &#8220;When Auntie gets
balky then we have to do some volplaning.
Take a quick slide down, you know. She&#8217;s all
right; got a fine stability. Oh, fine! Except in
banking or running across the wind. Sometimes
wish she was a Bleriot. Then again, I
don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We love our Auntie, but oh, you dihedral
angle!&#8221; put in Jerry fervently.</p>

<p>His tone made his listeners smile, though
none of them had the slightest idea of what he
was talking about. Jack immediately following
his brother&#8217;s remarks with a further account of
their flight and descent that afternoon, the
Khaki Boys forebore inquiring into the nature
of that mystifying term &#8220;dihedral angle.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tour of inspection concluded the twins
launched a volley of eager questions concern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ing
the Army and life at Camp Sterling, such as
&#8220;How long have you been in camp?&#8221; &#8220;Do you
like it?&#8221; &#8220;How long do you suppose it will be
before you go over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe we wouldn&#8217;t like to give old Auntie
a whack at the Boches,&#8221; declared valiant
Jerry. &#8220;I&#8217;ll bet we could do up a few Prussians
before we got ours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s this way with us,&#8221; confided Jack.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve had practice and made some fair
flights. Next week we&#8217;re off to enlist in the
Aviation Corps, if they&#8217;ll take us. We&#8217;re just
past nineteen, but Uncle Edward has given his
consent. We know a little bit about the flying
game besides handling the plane. Ever since
the war began we&#8217;ve been studying up on engines,
machine guns, military law and all that.
We can make maps and read &#8217;em too. We&#8217;ll
have to go to an Aero school, if we&#8217;re accepted,
but when we get there we&#8217;re going to pretty
soon show &#8217;em from the start that we&#8217;re regular
flyers. A good many fellows that go into the
aviation corps never see their chance to get off
of the ground. But not the Twinkle Twins.
We&#8217;re crazy to go over quick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe bob up in front of good old Emile
and spring a surprise on him,&#8221; averred Jerry,
who seemed fond of supplementing his brother&#8217;s
remarks with one or two of his own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hope we&#8217;ll see you again before you go,&#8221;
Jimmy said warmly. &#8220;Why can&#8217;t you come up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
to camp to-morrow? We&#8217;d be glad to show <em>you</em>
around. We&#8217;re all going home on Wednesday
for Thanksgiving. By the time we get back
you may be gone.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Much obliged for the invitation. We&#8217;ll take
you up on it and drive over to-morrow afternoon
in the racer. We went up there once when
we first came east. Since then we&#8217;ve been
pretty busy with Auntie. Never happened to
fly so near Sterling until to-day. We&#8217;ve always
started off in other directions. You&#8217;ll have to
wise us where to find you and all about it. We
don&#8217;t want to miss seeing you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell us what time you&#8217;ll be there and we&#8217;ll
meet you in front of the Y. M. C. A.,&#8221; proposed
Roger. &#8220;How about two P. M. to-morrow?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O. K.,&#8221; replied Jack.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;ll suit us,&#8221; from Jerry.</p>

<p>A cordial but hasty handshaking all around,
and the Khaki Boys departed, casting frequent
backward glances at the aeroplane. Its owners
had already begun to busy themselves with
&#8220;Auntie&#8221; preparatory to taking flight.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be great to fly,&#8221; glowed Bob.
&#8220;Those twins are wonders. I mean the way
they&#8217;ve rigged up that plane and all that. I
had to smile to myself, though, at what that
one said about flying Auntie against the Boches.
You can figure how long that little light-weight,
with its patchy wings and misfiring engine,
would last against a Fokker. Bing, bang!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
Away goes Auntie; all shot to pieces. They&#8217;ve
got the proper spirit, just the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wish we would meet &#8217;em again in France,&#8221;
emphasized Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was struck dumb when they claimed
Voissard as a relative,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;If it
hadn&#8217;t been for that Red Cross Bazaar we&#8217;d
never have met the Twinkle Twins. Talk about
looking alike! They certainly are the original
duplicates. But for goodness&#8217; sake, what&#8217;s a
dihedral angle?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ask me. You know more about planes
now than either Blazes or I,&#8221; shrugged Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to know,&#8221; deplored Bob. &#8220;Never
was sent out to do an aeroplane story when I
was on the <em>Chronicle</em>. I&#8217;ve read quite a lot
about planes since the war began. Mostly about
the newer types, though. That Antoinette of
theirs isn&#8217;t one of them. It&#8217;s a fairly old-timer.
I&#8217;m going to hunt up that dihedral angle puzzle
in my dictionary.&#8221;</p>

<p>Back in camp barely in time for mess, Bob
was forced to postpone his search for information
concerning the mystifying angle. Returned
to barracks from the mess hall he consulted a
medium-sized, fat, black dictionary.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here you are,&#8221; he presently informed his
still unenlightened bunkies. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a picture
of Auntie, and here&#8217;s a Bleriot. See the difference?
See the way the wings of this Antoinette
are set in a slight V? There&#8217;s your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
old dihedral angle. Look at this Bleriot. Its
one plane is set in a rigid horizontal line. Now
I&#8217;m going to read up on this. Oh, wait till to-morrow.
I&#8217;ll make the Twinkle Twins think
I&#8217;m the man that taught Cousin Emile how to
fly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those two must have done a lot of studying
by themselves,&#8221; observed Roger. &#8220;I suppose
being at Standford University has helped them
some. I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s a fine college. Many
of its students have gone into the aviation
corps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, those Twinkles have just absorbed
knowledge of aeroplanes like a sponge takes up
water,&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s sage opinion. &#8220;They&#8217;ve
made it their chief interest in life. Sort of following
in their cousin&#8217;s footsteps, you know.
They&#8217;re lucky to have had the chance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it&#8217;s hard for ordinary enlisted
men in the aviation corps to get a chance to
fly,&#8221; mused Roger. &#8220;Our training must be easy
beside what they have to go through.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of &#8217;em haven&#8217;t the foundation to start
with,&#8221; rejoined Bob. &#8220;It takes a trained mind
to get away with all a man has to learn before
he ever starts to fly. Then again, with all he
knows he may never develop into a flyer. It
may not be in him to make good. It&#8217;s a great
game, but I&#8217;ll bet it carries a lot of disappointed
sore-heads along with it. I&#8217;d never want to
tackle it. I&#8217;d sure be one of &#8217;em.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>The tardy arrival of Ignace who had been on
detail in the mess kitchen of late, turned the
conversation back to the subject of the Twinkle
Twins themselves. The Pole was duly regaled
with an account of the afternoon&#8217;s adventure,
to which he listened in rapt silence. Much to
the surprise of his bunkies, he earnestly begged
his Brothers not to introduce him to the illustrious
twins on the morrow. &#8220;You no bring
here,&#8221; he entreated.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter with you, Iggy? They
won&#8217;t bite you.&#8221; Jimmy finally grew a trifle
impatient. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to bring &#8217;em up here
on purpose to meet <em>you</em>, &#8217;cause you can&#8217;t go to
the &#8216;Y&#8217; with us to meet <em>them</em>. Do you get me?
That goes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So-o-o!&#8221; Ignace looked desperate but made
no further objection. In fact he said little more
that evening. Apparently losing all interest in
his bunkies&#8217; new acquaintances, he retired to
his cot and occupied himself in a laborious study
of Roger&#8217;s manual, which he had at last begun
to &#8220;un&#8217;erstan&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>When, at precisely two o&#8217;clock on Sunday
afternoon the twin guests arrived and were
presently conducted in triumph to Company E&#8217;s
barrack by their boyish hosts, Ignace was missing
from the squad room. Nor did he put in an
appearance until just before time for the evening
mess, at least half an hour after his
bunkies had bade their visitors a reluctant fare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>well
and watched them drive off down the company
street in their racer.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a nice one!&#8221; greeted Jimmy in pretended
disgust. &#8220;Where have you been keeping
yourself? Maybe you were ashamed to be
seen with us! What do you mean by quitting
us cold? You&#8217;re a fine sort of Brother, you
are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy&#8217;s energetic salutation brought a dull
flush to the Pole&#8217;s cheeks. His china-blue eyes
showed real distress. He gulped, sighed,
shifted from one foot to the other, then faltered
out: &#8220;Never I shame to go by you an&#8217; Bob an&#8217;
Roger. So have I the respet to my Brothar.
Such gran&#8217; fren&#8217; see me, think I no much, think
mebbe you no much, too. You tell you have
&#8217;nother Brothar, all right, they don&#8217;t see. They
see&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Ignace made a gesture expressive of
his lowly opinion of himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well of all the modest violets, you&#8217;re the
flower of the bunch!&#8221; was Bob&#8217;s satirical
tribute.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve a nice opinion of us, Iggy.&#8221;
Roger&#8217;s twitching lips belied his reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s take him over to the shower bath and
duck him,&#8221; proposed Jimmy. &#8220;Of all the bosh
I ever listened to that&#8217;s the boshiest. Wake
up, Iggy! You&#8217;re not at a social tea. You&#8217;re
in the Army now, and in bad, too, just on my

<h2>CHAPTER XVI<br />

<small>UNKNOWN, UNGUESSED</small></h2>


<p>At noon on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving,
Roger, Jimmy and Bob said a
regretful good-bye to Ignace and sallied
forth to the station bound for a four days&#8217; furlough
with the Blaises. Due to Jimmy&#8217;s
thoughtfulness, Ignace had that very morning
received a Thanksgiving box of good things to
eat from Mrs. Blaise that had astonished him
almost to tears. He had never before come
into such a windfall, and his round blue eyes
grew rounder when after the departure of his
bunkies he explored the contents of this holiday
treat.</p>

<p>His first thought was of someone with whom
he might share it. Franz Schnitzel appealed to
him as most worthy of choice. Like himself,
Schnitzel never received either money or gifts
from home.</p>

<p>Thanksgiving Day ended Ignace&#8217;s detail in
the mess kitchen. The day following ended his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
period of punishment. On Saturday afternoon
he and Schnitzel obtained passes and went into
Tremont for a quiet but happy little celebration
of their own. All in all, Ignace was not so
lonely as he had expected to be. Though he
sorely missed his Brothers, he was unselfishly
glad of the good time they were having at
Jimmy&#8217;s home. Evidence of that reached him
on Saturday afternoon in the shape of post
cards from all three, which he lugged happily
about in a coat pocket for a week after their
return.</p>

<p>Detail of Schnitzel to kitchen duty on Sunday
morning robbed Ignace of his company at breakfast.
During the absence of his bunkies, Ignace
and the German-American had daily sat side by
side at mess, saying little but nevertheless well
content in each other&#8217;s society. They were becoming
very good friends.</p>

<p>Sunday noon landed Bob, Jimmy and Roger
in barracks with a rush. They pounced upon
Ignace with good-humored roughness and plied
him with endless questions about himself and
his doings during their absence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now for the love of Mike, Iggy, do behave
like a little tin soldier until Christmas,&#8221; admonished
Bob. &#8220;Jimmy&#8217;s folks want us with
them for the Christmas furlough. That means
you. If you happen to see anybody trying to
slay us all in a bunch, let &#8217;em try, but you keep
out of the slaying. You&#8217;ve done your stretch.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
Be satisfied. Let somebody else get it in the
neck for a change.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was not until in the evening when the four
Khaki Boys were leaving the &#8220;Y,&#8221; where they
had spent an hour after mess, that Jimmy bethought
himself to ask Iggy, &#8220;Did Schnitzel
have any trouble with Bixton while we were
gone? I heard before we left that Bixton was
wild because he had to stay in camp. I thought,
maybe, he&#8217;d try to take it out on Schnitz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. He no do nothin&#8217;, no say nothin&#8217;. He
have the big box to eat he get by home. Himself
eat, no give nothin&#8217;. All time smoke an&#8217;
look mad. Schnitzel no care. He stay by me.
We are the frens.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Himself eat,&#8217;&#8221; mimicked Jimmy. &#8220;I wish
he would, and not leave a scrap!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You should worry. He&#8217;s safe for a while.
He won&#8217;t risk any more run-ins with the K. O.
for fear of getting canned up for Christmas.
Bottled Bixton doesn&#8217;t look good to him just
now.&#8221; Bob grinned at his own fanciful labeling
of the obstreperous Bixton.</p>

<p>&#8220;I guess he&#8217;s about through as a trouble
bird,&#8221; observed Jimmy. &#8220;That detail in the
mess kitchen must have cured him. I&#8217;ll bet he
hated to go to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never I like him that kitchen,&#8221; sighed
Ignace. &#8220;Schnitzel no mind. He ver&#8217; good
solder. Say&mdash;say&mdash;&mdash; What him say?&#8221;
Wrestling with memory, Ignace ended with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
triumphant, &#8220;Him say, &#8216;All the duty him a
line&#8217;!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, wow!&#8221; shouted Bob gleefully, slapping
Iggy on the back. &#8220;That&#8217;s a funny one!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the grow stron&#8217;er,&#8221; placidly remarked
the misquoter, unruffled by Bob&#8217;s levity.</p>

<p>Taps that night left the Khaki Boys ready for
a quick hike into dreamland. The next day
dawned like any one day at Camp Sterling,
with a concerted rush on the part of several
thousand Sammies to get into their uniforms
and line up for roll call.</p>

<p>&#8220;With all due credit to our hard-plugging
cooks, I&#8217;m not what you might call a hearty
eater,&#8221; grumbled Bob to Roger, as the Khaki
Boys of Company E stood before the counter
in the mess hall at noon. &#8220;Mrs. Blaise&#8217;s cook
beats Mrs. Army&#8217;s hash maidens all hollow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <em>is</em> a come down.&#8221; Roger smiled at Bob&#8217;s
nonsense. &#8220;I&#8217;m not very hungry, either. I&#8217;ve
lost my appetite, I guess, from eating so much
sweet stuff. No more of it for me to-day or
to-morrow either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor me.&#8221; Having received his portion in
his mess kit, Bob eyed it with disfavor.
&#8220;Beans,&#8221; he commented. &#8220;I&#8217;ll try &#8217;em. This
pale, simple, gooey rice pudding&mdash;&mdash; No, thank
you. Bobby has chok&#8217;lit candy and nice cake
in his suit-case. Go &#8217;way, nasty old pudding!&#8221;</p>

<p>His scornful repudiation of the unoffending
rice pudding was not the only one. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Jimmy nor Roger were tempted to the point of
trying it. Ignace swallowed one small spoonful
and with a disdainful, &#8220;No taste nothin,&#8221; ate
no more of it. The glories of his wonderful
Thanksgiving treat were still hovering over
him, hence his will to criticize everyday fare.</p>

<p>Shortly after one o&#8217;clock Assembly something
happened to the platoon of Company E men of
which the four Khaki Boys were a part. In
the midst of drill a soldier dropped his rifle,
clapped both hands over his stomach with a
deep groan, and, doubling up like a jack-knife,
pitched forward to the ground, a writhing heap.
Hardly had the lieutenant commanding the
platoon reached him when a second, then a third
man collapsed in precisely the same fashion.</p>

<p>In the next few moments the lieutenant fully
demonstrated his prompt ability to act in the
face of an emergency. Taking instant command
of the situation, he rapped out his orders
with crispness and dispatch. Before aid had
arrived, however, from the nearby base hospital,
at least a dozen more men were showing
signs of the strange malady. These last, Ignace
among them, were still able to keep on their
feet. Only the first three victims were entirely
out of commission.</p>

<p>The arrival of an ambulance, manned by a
detail of men attached to the base hospital, saw
the work of caring for the sufferers speedily
under way. Already ordered to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span> &#8220;Fall Out,&#8221;
the still unaffected men of the platoon were
dismissed with the order &#8220;To Barracks.&#8221; They
were also instructed to report at the hospital at
the slightest sign of indisposition.</p>

<p>During the excitement an ominous whisper
had winged its way among the dismayed participants
in the tragic scene which presently grew
to an audible murmur of &#8220;Poison!&#8221; At that
dread word, unspoken questions leaped into the
strained eyes of the gray-faced men who had
thus far felt no indications of that baleful
seizure. In the same instant it had come home
to each that in some stealthy fashion one of the
myriad secret enemies of Uncle Sam had found
his opportunity to strike. In the midst of apparent
safety had lurked an unknown, unguessed
foe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII<br />

<small>THE WORK OF A FIEND</small></h2>


<p>Returned to barracks three more men
of Platoon 4, Company E, were added to
the list of sufferers from that sinister
seizure. As a result those still unvisited by it
were promptly ordered to report at the regimental
hospital for treatment. The fact that a
number of Company E men at drill in other
platoons had also collapsed had increased the
gravity of the affair to a point that required
instant action on the part of the medical department.
The symptoms of the peculiar malady
were such as to indicate poisoning. They
called for speedy investigation and the administering
of a precautionary antidote to such of the
men as had thus far showed no signs of sickening.</p>

<p>It was the first real catastrophe that had ever
struck Camp Sterling and the news of it spread
like wildfire throughout the camp. To one and
all it seemed almost incredible that a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span> &#8220;poison
plot&#8221; had reached successful culmination in
Company E mess kitchen. Undoubtedly it <em>had</em>
centered there. None other than men from
Company E&#8217;s barracks had felt any ill effects
from their noon meal. Yet who could guess as
to how far such a calamity might extend?</p>

<p>Released from drill for the balance of the
day, the half hour between Retreat and mess
that evening marked the ending of a troubled
afternoon in Company E barracks. An air of
deep gloom hung over the squad room in which
the four Khaki Boys bunked.</p>

<p>Bob, Jimmy and Roger were in especially low
spirits. Ranged in a dejected row on Roger&#8217;s
cot they were a most unhappy trio.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s awful,&#8221; groaned Jimmy. &#8220;Poor old
Iggy. He looked ready to croak when they took
him to the hospital. What do you suppose it
was that poisoned &#8217;em? We ate the same stuff
they did and we&#8217;re all right&mdash;yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you know yet what poisoned &#8217;em?&#8221;
Bent forward, chin in hand, Bob straightened
up with a jerk. &#8220;I&#8217;ll tell you. It was the rice
pudding. We didn&#8217;t touch it, but poor old Iggy
did.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By George, that&#8217;s so! I must be thick not
to have doped out that much for myself. I&#8217;d
forgotten about Iggy&#8217;s starting to eat it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So had I.&#8221; Roger looked disgusted at his
own forgetfulness. &#8220;That&#8217;s why a lot of
men didn&#8217;t get sick. They passed up the pud<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>ding,
too, because Thanksgiving sweet stuff
made &#8217;em finicky.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught it the minute that rain-maker over
at the hospital asked me what I ate for dinner,&#8221;
declared Bob. &#8220;He gave me a queer look when
I told him &#8216;no pudding&#8217; and made a note of it.
I was going to mention it to you, then I thought
I&#8217;d wait and let you figure it out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then they must know it already at headquarters,&#8221;
asserted Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sure they know it,&#8221; nodded Bob. &#8220;Whatever
was left of that rice pudding is under
chemical analysis by this time. They have to
act quickly in a case like this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Iggy may pull through all right.&#8221; Jimmy
brightened. &#8220;He only ate one spoonful of the
stuff. I was watching him. He tried it and
said: &#8216;No taste nothin&#8217;.&#8217; Then he didn&#8217;t touch
it again. I know, &#8217;cause right afterward we all
beat it out of the mess hall. What about Simpson,
though? I can see him yet, and hear him
groan.&#8221;</p>

<p>Simpson had been the first man to collapse.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor fellow.&#8221; Roger&#8217;s tones vibrated with
intense sympathy. &#8220;He&#8217;s a fine man and a
splendid soldier. I&#8217;ve been expecting every day
to see him jump to corporal. Now&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; He
paused, reluctant to voice his doubt of Simpson&#8217;s
recovery.</p>

<p>&#8220;It might turn out not to be poison, you
know,&#8221; said Bob reflectively. &#8220;Somebody may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
have dosed the pudding with something that
would make the men deathly sick and yet not
finish &#8217;em. Only hope that&#8217;s the case. This
will raise some ructions here in camp, believe
me. Every one of those guys in the mess kitchen&#8217;ll
be held for a third degree. No one&#8217;s supposed
to have anything to do with the grub but
them. Yet they might all be as innocent as
babies. Some fiend may have doctored the rice
or the milk before it ever struck camp.&#8221; Wise
in the ways of the newspaper world, Bob was
already full of plausible theories concerning
the dreadful affair.</p>

<p>&#8220;Suppose it was poison, nobody could accuse
a man on kitchen detail unless pretty good
proof of it came up against him,&#8221; stoutly asserted
Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll grill the whole bunch to a standstill.
If any one of &#8217;em shows the least sign of guilt&mdash;Bing!
Into the jug he goes for trial by a court
martial. If he&#8217;s found guilty, Bang! Porous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe a man in this camp would
do such a horrible thing!&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s voice rang
with intense loyalty.</p>

<p>&#8220;We hope not,&#8221; gravely rejoined Bob. &#8220;You
can never tell, though. This whole country&#8217;s
honey-combed with spies and myrmidons of the
Central Powers. The Secret Service has run
down more of &#8217;em than anyone can guess at. I
know of a few things from being on the <em>Chronicle</em>.
Sometimes I&#8217;ve thought we&#8217;re all asleep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
over here. But we&#8217;re waking up. Too bad it
took us so long to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee, but I&#8217;m glad Iggy went off kitchen duty
before this happened! Missed it by only two
days!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just in time to get doped, instead of getting
hauled up for doping,&#8221; retorted Bob. &#8220;It&#8217;s
about as bad one way as the other.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you!&#8221; Jimmy grew indignant. &#8220;You
know I didn&#8217;t mean it that way. Just the same,
I&#8217;d rather he&#8217;d be in hospital than under a cloud
because some others are there. I&#8217;d hate to see
a friend of mine in bad for&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend of <em>ours is</em> in bad!&#8221; Bob fairly
bounced to his feet. &#8220;Schnitz is on kitchen
detail! Great Jehosephat! And he&#8217;s a German-American,
too!&#8221;</p>

<p>Into three pairs of eyes leaped a consternation
born of this belated reflection. It looked as
though Schnitz was in for it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tough luck,&#8221; emphasized Jimmy, equally
concerned over Schnitzel&#8217;s predicament. &#8220;Too
bad it wasn&#8217;t Bixton instead.&#8221; Jimmy cast an
unfriendly glance across the squad room to
where Bixton, as usual, lounged on his cot. He
also had escaped disaster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, come now.&#8221; Roger could not refrain
from smiling. &#8220;You don&#8217;t mean that, Blazes.
It&#8217;s wrong to wish trouble on any man, no matter
what he may be. I don&#8217;t believe even
Schnitzel would wish that on Bixton, and h<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>e&#8217;s
had to take a lot from that sneak. Schnitz is
too&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, where is Schnitz?&#8221; Jimmy was
staring darkly at Schnitzel&#8217;s empty cot.
&#8220;Maybe he&#8217;s in hospital, too. He wasn&#8217;t at
drill, so we don&#8217;t know&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether he&#8217;s in hospital or in arrest,&#8221; finished
Bob significantly, &#8220;I haven&#8217;t seen a man
on kitchen detail since noon. You can draw
your own conclusions. Right after mess to-night
I&#8217;m going out news-gathering. I&#8217;ll bet I
find out something, too. I know where I can get
some information.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mess!&#8221; grimaced Jimmy. &#8220;I hate to think
of it. I&#8217;m not hungry enough to risk getting
mine to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We all feel the same,&#8221; agreed Bob. &#8220;They
say lightning never strikes twice in the same
place, though. I won&#8217;t be a quitter. I&#8217;ll take a
chance. Probably we&#8217;ll get something solid to
eat to-night that it would be hard to doctor.
You can look for some new faces in the mess
kitchen. Take my word for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s prediction was verified almost to the
letter. Supper that night consisted of bread,
boiled potatoes and beefsteak, served by a new
detail of kitchen men. Not one of the old detail
was on duty, which went to prove that they were
either ill or had been held on suspicion.</p>

<p>The three Khaki Boys never forgot that particular
meal. Each felt that every mouthful of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
food he ate might contain a fatal dose of poison.
Iggy&#8217;s absence also greatly added to their depression.
All hoped for the best, yet feared the
worst. The same heavy oppression clutched
their comrades, who alike had bunkies of their
own to worry over.</p>

<p>Bob returned to barracks with Roger and
Jimmy, only to sally forth again on his quest for
news. Jimmy was anxious to go with him, but
for once Bob did not desire company. &#8220;Bobby&#8217;s
got to go it by himself,&#8221; he objected. &#8220;You&#8217;re
a lovely young corporal, Blazes, but you don&#8217;t
fit into my plan. &#8216;He travels fastest who travels
alone,&#8217; you know. Any other time I&#8217;d be delighted,
but, to quote our dear, I won&#8217;t say
departed, Iggy, &#8216;no now.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Tattoo had sounded before Bob reappeared,
his black eyes glittering with suppressed excitement.
&#8220;I&#8217;ve had a busy evening,&#8221; he announced,
as Jimmy and Roger began hurling
eager questions at him. &#8220;Pile onto my cot and
I&#8217;ll tell you what I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Fire away,&#8221; ordered Jimmy impatiently as
the three gathered together, eager to hear what
Bob had discovered.</p>

<p>&#8220;First of all, Iggy&#8217;s better.&#8221; Bob beamed,
as he told this important news. &#8220;He wasn&#8217;t
nearly so sick as the rest. He may be back here
to-morrow night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hooray!&#8221; rejoiced Jimmy, though in a very
moderate tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine!&#8221; Roger&#8217;s sober features grew
radiant.</p>

<p>&#8220;Simpson&#8217;s gone west.&#8221; The light faded
from Bob&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>&#8220;When&mdash;did&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Jimmy could not
bring himself to say the dread word.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon after they took him to hospital.&#8221; Bob
was silent for a moment. &#8220;He&mdash;he&mdash;suffered
terribly. One of those two that dropped right
afterward is&mdash;is&mdash;gone. Brady, that slim,
curly-headed fellow, that was always laughing.
The other may pull through. All the rest will,
I guess. They&#8217;re pretty sure it was the pudding.
Simpson asked for a second portion of
the stuff. I&#8217;d like to get my hands on the fiend
that poisoned it. I&#8217;d choke the life out of him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re taking it hard at headquarters,&#8221;
Bob continued. &#8220;The K. O.&#8217;s wild about it.
Says he&#8217;ll never rest till he gets the one who
did it. That&#8217;s what I heard. I didn&#8217;t have a
personal interview with him.&#8221; This last with
grim humor. &#8220;They gathered in the k. m.&#8217;s before
they&#8217;d finished their work. Don&#8217;t know
what&#8217;s been done to &#8217;em, so far. Couldn&#8217;t get
a line on that. Don&#8217;t know whether the story
broke in time for an evening extra or not. I
couldn&#8217;t get one. The morning papers will be
full of it. There&#8217;ll be a bunch of reporters on
the scene to-morrow. It&#8217;s hinted that arsenic
was used. Nobody&#8217;ll know that, though, until
the pudding&#8217;s been analyzed and post mortem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
held on&mdash;on&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Bob drew a sharp, whistling
breath. &#8220;A dog&#8217;s death for two brave fellows
to die,&#8221; he went on with intense bitterness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet they died in their country&#8217;s service,&#8221;
reminded Roger softly. &#8220;They did their level
best for Uncle Sam while they lasted. Brady
and Simpson; splendid boys and good soldiers.&#8221;
Unconsciously, Roger had voiced the finest
eulogy that a man could desire to have spoken
of him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, we mustn&#8217;t forget that,&#8221; assented Bob
sadly. &#8220;This has been a horrible day. I wish
I could wipe it off my slate. But I can&#8217;t. And
then there&#8217;s Schnitz to think of. Anything out
of the ordinary happen while I was gone?&#8221; he
asked with sudden irrelevance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a thing. Why?&#8221; Jimmy detected
anxiety in the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought maybe there&#8217;d be a guard detail
sent to go through the kitchen men&#8217;s stuff. It&#8217;s
too early for that, I guess. You don&#8217;t suppose
Schnitz would have anything among his traps
that might look bad for him, do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What could he have?&#8221; wondered Roger.
&#8220;We know he couldn&#8217;t have any poison. What
else could there be?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing.&#8221; Bob hesitated. &#8220;It&#8217;s only on account
of his nationality. You know how Bixton&#8217;s
talked about him. You know, too, why our
fellows were poisoned. He&#8217;s the only G. A. in
this barrack. He was on kitchen duty. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
suppose he had some trifle among his belongings
that was perfectly all right in itself, but looked
fishy to the search party? It&#8217;s not likely to be
so, but it might be.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII<br />

<small>THE CLUE</small></h2>


<p>What transpired the next day seemed
to the Khaki Boys more in the nature
of a wild nightmare than stark reality.
As Bob had foreseen, morning brought a flock
of newspaper men from not too far distant
cities to the scene of the disaster.</p>

<p>Excitement, however, reached fever heat when
the latest editions of the evening papers flaunted
black scareheads such as, &#8220;Soldier Suspected
of Poisoning His Comrades.&#8221; &#8220;Incriminating
Evidence Found Among Soldier&#8217;s Belongings.&#8221;
&#8220;Franz Schnitzel, a German-American, Accused
as Poisoner,&#8221; and similar glaring headlines.</p>

<p>That same morning a guard detail had entered
Company E&#8217;s barracks with instructions
to search the belongings of such of the kitchen
men detained on suspicion who were housed in
those barracks. Nothing of importance had
been unearthed except in the suitcase of Schnitzel.
What had been found there was deemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
sufficiently serious in character to warrant holding
him on a charge of murder, to await trial by
a court martial. Not only had a medium-sized
bottle of powdered glass been taken from the
suitcase, but also a typed sheet of paper, listing
various poisons, together with annotations as to
the effect, length of time required to act, and the
more or less deadly qualities of each.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never believe it of Schnitz. Never!&#8221; exclaimed
Jimmy Blaise passionately. Tucked
into a corner of the &#8220;Y&#8221; writing room, with
Roger and Bob, the three had just finished reading
the account of the affair, as set forth in the
evening papers. &#8220;Schnitz isn&#8217;t guilty any
more than I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Schnitz isn&#8217;t guilty, of course.&#8221; Bob gave
a contemptuous snort. &#8220;In the first place, I
don&#8217;t believe it was powdered glass that went
into that pudding. I&#8217;ll bet the findings of the
autopsy and chemical analysis will prove that it
was something else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he&#8217;ll be cleared of the charge, won&#8217;t
he?&#8221; eagerly asked Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Cleared nothing,&#8221; was the gloomy retort.
&#8220;He&#8217;ll be third degreed to a frazzle to make
him confess that he used the poison that did the
killing. That list of poisons and the bottle of
powdered glass are too strong evidence against
him to be overlooked. He&#8217;s been caught with
the goods, you might say. <em>I</em> say he&#8217;s been
caught in a trap laid by an <em>enemy</em>.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t mean you think that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221; Jimmy
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do mean just that. But before I say more,
let me ask you something. Was Bixton in the
squad room all last evening while I was out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t remember.&#8221; Jimmy frowned reflectively.
&#8220;Let me think. I saw him sitting on
his cot around seven o&#8217;clock. After that&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He <em>did</em> go out,&#8221; interrupted Roger. &#8220;I saw
him go. It was about half-past seven, I guess.
He came back in a great hurry, too, about ten
minutes before Taps sounded. I was just turning
in. You fellows were both in bed. I was
thinking about poor Schnitz when I saw Bixton
and Eldridge hustle in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s done it then; queered Schnitz just as
he threatened.&#8221; Bob&#8217;s accusation contained
savage conviction. &#8220;He put that stuff in
Schnitz&#8217;s suitcase some time during the night.
It would be a cinch for him, because he bunks
next to Schnitz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how and where could he get the glass
in such a hurry?&#8221; demanded Jimmy. &#8220;There&#8217;s
the list, too. Bixton&#8217;s not smart enough to make
any such list himself. Besides, he wouldn&#8217;t be
able to get hold of a book on poisons in this
camp, and he certainly wasn&#8217;t away from camp
in that short time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those are some of the things we must figure
out.&#8221; Bob&#8217;s lips set in a straight line. &#8220;This
is no joke. It&#8217;s a life or death proposition for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Schnitz. Very well. Now we&#8217;re going to keep
close mouths and run this thing down.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go to the K. O. and tell him about it,&#8221;
proposed Jimmy eagerly. &#8220;He&#8217;d take it up in
a hurry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s your proof to back it?&#8221; shrugged
Bob. &#8220;You can&#8217;t accuse a man offhand of such
a serious thing. No; we must watch and wait
and work, and spring the trap on Bix just the
way he watched and waited, and sprang the
trap on Schnitz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We might be too late to do any good,&#8221; demurred
Roger gravely.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you believe it,&#8221; disagreed Bob.
&#8220;This affair won&#8217;t come to a head in a hurry.
There&#8217;ll be more or less delay and argument
over the poison itself. Then there&#8217;ll be a merry
chase for more evidence. The K. O.&#8217;s not
anxious to see one of our men condemned for
murder. There are so many German plots floating
around that this business will be thoroughly
sifted first. Suppose the poison had been mixed
in the rice before it was cooked or put in the
milk. All that has to be looked into and it will
be. The papers say that the Secretary of War
intends to investigate this thing to the limit.
That means he&#8217;s going to give Schnitz a chance
for his life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Maybe Bixton had something to do with the
poisoning,&#8221; Jimmy theorized. &#8220;He&#8217;s a slacker.
We know that. Maybe <em>he&#8217;s</em> a traitor, too.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing doing.&#8221; Bob shook his head.
&#8220;He&#8217;s only mixed up in queering Schnitz. He
saw his chance and grabbed it. I&#8217;d sooner think
it might be one of the fellows on kitchen detail
with Schnitzel than Bixton. Bix and Iggy both
finished their kitchen detail at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tough luck.&#8221; Jimmy vented his feelings in
his favorite expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tough it is, but maybe not forever. My
fighting blood is up, and I&#8217;m going to camp on
the trail of that hound, Bixton, until I get something
definite to hang on him,&#8221; vowed Bob. &#8220;I
want you two to keep an eye on him whenever
you can. Watch where he goes, what he does,
and the men he talks with. Be careful not to let
him catch you at it, though. That&#8217;ll be your
part of the scheme.&#8221; Bob rose and rolled up
the newspaper he had been reading.</p>

<p>&#8220;What are <em>you</em> going to do. What&#8217;s your
part going to be?&#8221; Jimmy wanted to know.</p>

<p>&#8220;Same as yours, only more so,&#8221; grinned Bob.
&#8220;I&#8217;m going to gather information about that
kitchen detail, Bixton, Eldridge and anyone else
who needs looking up. I&#8217;m going to be an investigator.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s earnest proposal that the three of them
take to sleuthing on their own hook fired the
enthusiasm of both Roger and Jimmy. Here
was a real mystery to solve, more baffling than
any they had ever followed in fiction. On their
ability to ferret it out rested not only Schnitz<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>el&#8217;s
life, but the saving of his good name from
eternal dishonor.</p>

<p>The next two days, however, were painfully
devoid of results. Close and constant watch on
Bixton developed nothing that could be used
against him.</p>

<p>Ignace had now returned to the fold a paler
and slightly thinner edition of himself. According
to himself he had been &#8220;&#8216;ver&#8217; seek, but
no so seek som&#8217; other.&#8221; He was greatly cast
down over Schnitzel&#8217;s plight, and sturdily expressed
his belief in the other&#8217;s innocence. He
was equally eager to do whatever Bob advised,
and solemnly promised, &#8220;Watch all time.&#8221;</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day after
Schnitzel&#8217;s arrest, Jimmy, Roger and Ignace received
a summons to headquarters. At a loss
to recollect any misdemeanor on their part, they
went, wondering mightily why the K. O. should
wish to see them. Once in the presence of their
commanding officer they met with a shock. Before
them, spread out on the major&#8217;s desk, lay
several letters, minus their envelopes, which reposed
beside them. Each man was in turn
requested to glance over the letter to which was
affixed his signature, and state whether he had
written it and at what time. It is needless to
say that all told the same story. The letters on
the major&#8217;s desk were the letters that had so
mysteriously vanished during the Khaki Boys&#8217;
first week in camp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span></p>

<p>Having duly explained this to the K. O.&#8217;s
satisfaction, they were treated to a second bewildering
surprise. These very letters, it
seemed, had been found in Schnitzel&#8217;s suitcase.
Major Stearns had opened them, as a point of
duty, and had claimed the right to withhold them
in order to make an inquiry. Shown to
Schnitzel, he had stubbornly denied ever having
seen them before.</p>

<p>&#8220;You state, Blaise, that these letters were
stolen from a shelf over your cot on the same
night that they were written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, sir.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any reason for believing that it
was Schnitzel who stole them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir. I <em>know</em> Schnitzel didn&#8217;t steal
them.&#8221; Jimmy emphasized the &#8216;know&#8217; strongly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you so positive that he did not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because, sir, Schnitzel wasn&#8217;t that sort.
He&#8217;s a true man, and he&#8217;s innocent of the crime
he&#8217;s charged with.&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s sympathies overcame
his awe of Major Stearns.</p>

<p>&#8220;Humph!&#8221; The K. O. allowed this opinion
to stand unrebuked. He was fond of Jimmy,
and rather admired him for his staunch defense
of the accused soldier. &#8220;Is that your only
reason?&#8221;</p>

<p>Tardily recalling Bob&#8217;s injunction to secrecy
regarding Bixton, Jimmy hesitated, then cautiously
answered:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span> &#8220;We were not acquainted
with Schnitzel, sir, at the time we wrote those
letters. There was no reason why he should
want to take them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still you can&#8217;t give me any proof that he
didn&#8217;t, can you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir.&#8221; Jimmy breathed freely again.</p>

<p>Receiving this negative, the major proceeded
to question first Roger, then Ignace, with practically
the same result. Profiting by Jimmy&#8217;s
mistake, neither volunteered more than was
necessary. In the end they left headquarters
without their letters. The fact that these had
been stolen added to the case against Schnitzel.</p>

<p>The Khaki Boys left headquarters in
a state of intense excitement, manifested in
their eager exchange of remarks the moment
they were safely outside the building. Directly
after the disappearance of their letters
they had suspected Bixton of the theft. His
later attempt to get at Jimmy&#8217;s equipment had
strengthened the suspicion. Now the lost letters
had, at this late date, turned up in Schnitzel&#8217;s suitcase.
Actual proof against Bixton they
had none. That did not matter so much at present.
It would come. Why? Because at last
they had a clue, or what seemed to them a clue.
At least, it was a circumstance that connected
Bixton with Schnitzel. If Bixton had stolen the
letters that were found in Schnitzel&#8217;s suitcase,
it followed that no one save Bixton would have
placed them there, and not only the letters but
the bottle of powdered glass and the poison list.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX<br />

<small>A FRUITFUL RUBBISH CAN</small></h2>


<p>December heralded many comings and
goings at Camp Sterling. With almost
every day, a detachment of soldiers
marched to the station to return no more. Traveling
seaward by circuitous routes, the waiting
transports claimed them and bore them away
to &#8220;Over There.&#8221; The draft now in full swing,
hundreds of men constantly arrived to replace
them. Soldiering went on with a rush. Across
the water had come the Allies&#8217; cry, &#8220;More
Men!&#8221; and Uncle Sam did not propose to be behindhand
in furnishing his trench quota.</p>

<p>On the Saturday before Christmas our four
Khaki Boys departed in high glee on a four-days&#8217;
furlough, to be spent with the Blaise family.
Only one regret lurked beneath their exuberant
joy. It had to do with a forlorn
comrade, shut in the guard house, and apart
from all Christmas cheer. Schnitzel was still
awaiting trial, due to numerous halts in the ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>chinery
of military law, occasioned by the
thoroughness of the investigation. Once definitely
established that Company E&#8217;s men had
been the victim of arsenic poisoning, instead of
powdered glass, it became less easy to establish
Schnitzel&#8217;s guilt.</p>

<p>Grilled over and over again as to where he
had obtained the arsenic, his undaunted protest
of innocence was not without effect. Undoubtedly
he could not hope to escape trial. He was
the only man in camp against whom anything
incriminating had been discovered. Rigid testings
of supplies in the commissary departments
had yielded no further traces of poison. This
did away with the theory of outside agency, and
fastened the opprobrium more strongly on the
German-American.</p>

<p>&#8220;A friend in need is a friend indeed.&#8221; Shut
off from any possible opportunity to see
Schnitzel, the four Khaki Boys did not forget
him. Many verbal battles were fought by them
in his behalf. Few others beside themselves
believed him innocent.</p>

<p>Each of the quartette, including Iggy, had
written to Schnitzel cheerful, hopeful letters,
breathing firm belief in his innocence. All had
planned to buy him some token of remembrance
as soon as they went on their furlough.</p>

<p>Bob&#8217;s secret campaign to gain information
concerning Bixton, Eldridge and the kitchen
men on duty with Schnitzel at the time of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
poisoning had not been specially fruitful. He
gathered considerable data concerning Bixton,
not specially useful to his purpose, in that it
had no bearing on the mystery. What Bob
burned to know was the origin of the tabulated
list of poisons. He was now certain that Bixton
had not compiled it. He suspected Eldridge,
but of the latter he could find out little. He
was considerably older than Bixton, fairly well-educated,
but most uncommunicative except to
his bunkie. He claimed Buffalo as his home
town, but Bob believed him to be from the middle
West. His walk, voice and mannerisms
smacked faintly of the Hoosier.</p>

<p>On the Wednesday after Christmas, the noon
train into Camp Sterling unloaded its freight
of returned soldier boys, the four Brothers a
part of the throng that passed through the big
gates, and tramped the snowy roads to their
various barracks.</p>

<p>Much to his disgust, Bob found himself &#8220;settling
down&#8221; a good deal sooner than suited him.
According to the cold information of Sergeant
Dexter, a quantity of discarded wrapping paper,
together with numerous ends of string, had been
found under his cot on the previous Saturday
evening. Rebuked for untidiness, he was condemned
to a detail of policing barracks that
filled him with righteous wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can guess who was to blame for that,&#8221; he
sputtered angrily to Jimmy. &#8220;Eldridge put up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
that job on me. Bix went away on the same
train we did. The other sneak didn&#8217;t. It&#8217;s up
to him. I know it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Funny he didn&#8217;t do the same to the rest of
us,&#8221; commented Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, he wasn&#8217;t particular as to which of us
got it,&#8221; snapped Bob. &#8220;Probably he just
dumped those papers and beat it in a hurry.
Makes me sick. It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve got it in
the neck since I came to Sterling. I don&#8217;t mind
the detail. It&#8217;s being dished that makes me
sore. The worst of it is, I couldn&#8217;t say a word.
Just had to stand and take it from the Sarge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, well, it&#8217;s no great disgrace,&#8221; comforted
Jimmy. &#8220;Think of poor Schnitz.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am and I have. Do you realize that his
trial is bound to come off before long? According
to our manual, thirty days, with an additional
ten added if approved by military authorities,
is the longest a case can hang fire. I
don&#8217;t know whether that holds good in Schnitz&#8217;s
case. I should think so, though. Anyhow,
we&#8217;ve not done a thing for him. We&#8217;ve got to
get busy and do something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; Jimmy made a gesture of despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know yet, but I do know that it&#8217;s got
to be done mighty soon.&#8221; Bob shot a baleful
glance across the squad room toward Eldridge,
who was seated cross-legged on his cot, undoing
a small package. &#8220;Look at him!&#8221; muttered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
Bob, as the man proceeded to tear the outside
wrapper into strips. &#8220;More rubbish for Bobby
to cart away.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jimmy&#8217;s eyes followed Bob&#8217;s. Suddenly he
gripped the latter&#8217;s arm. &#8220;Maybe he got that
package in the mail. Maybe it&#8217;s from his home.
Maybe&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Great guns!&#8221; exclaimed Bob softly, and
swung round, his back toward Eldridge.
&#8220;Don&#8217;t let him see you rubbering, Blazes.
You&#8217;ve given me a jolt, though. I&#8217;m going to
watch what he does with those strips of paper
and nab &#8217;em. Oh, boy! Why is Bobby on police
duty?&#8221;</p>

<p>The paper presently went into a receptacle
at one end of the squad room, provided for that
purpose. When supper call sounded, Bob declined
to answer it. &#8220;You fellows go ahead,&#8221;
he directed. &#8220;I don&#8217;t want any supper. Later
on I&#8217;ll go down to the canteen, and fill up on
cakes and milk. This is my chance, and I&#8217;m going
to take it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The moment the squad room had emptied itself,
Bob sped to the rubbish can. Fortunately
for him, the scraps of paper he sought were of
a dull grayish green, and thus easily distinguished
from the rest of the can&#8217;s contents.
Quickly, but thoroughly, he searched, making
sure that he had every scrap of the paper he
sought in his possession. Too shrewd to attempt
to piece them together in the squad room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
he wrapped them in a handkerchief, and hurried
off to the Y. M. C. A.</p>

<p>It was over an hour later when he returned
to barracks, his black eyes snapping with
triumph.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what I know,&#8221; he exulted, dropping
down beside Jimmy, who was seated on his cot.
&#8220;Come on outside and I&#8217;ll show you something.
Where are the fellows?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They just went over to the canteen. Rodge
wanted to buy some soap to do his family washing
with. I told &#8217;em I&#8217;d wait here for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s find &#8217;em. I&#8217;m going canteenwards
myself to feed. We&#8217;ll probably meet &#8217;em
there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now show me,&#8221; demanded Jimmy, the moment
they were out in the company street.</p>

<p>Bob took a small flashlight and something
else from a trouser&#8217;s pocket. The &#8220;something
else&#8221; was a half-sheet of paper. Training the
flashlight upon it, he read, &#8220;&#8216;Alice E. Eldridge,
1205 N. Clark St., Chicago, Illinois.&#8217; That&#8217;s a
return address. I copied it, then got rid of the
papers. Had a great time piecing them together.
Regular Chinese puzzle. Now this is
what I&#8217;m going to do. I&#8217;ve a friend on the <em>Chicago
American</em>. As soon as I feed, I&#8217;m going
back to barracks and write to him. I&#8217;ll send
him this address, and ask him to get me all the
data he can about the Eldridge family.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX<br />

<small>A LEAP IN THE DARK</small></h2>


<p>Thursday, the day following the writing
and mailing of Bob&#8217;s letter, brought its
own surprises. Came the order that a
part of Company E&#8217;s men, along with a number
housed in other barracks, were to be transferred
to a camp many miles south of Sterling.
This in itself was to be expected. The majority
of the men ordered to pack received the
command with admirable tranquillity. It threw
the four Khaki Boys into panic, however. Not
because, with the exception of Jimmy, they
were to be among those to go. Even Jimmy was
to return. He was to have the proud honor of
going along merely to help escort the detachment
to their new quarters. What upset
the equanimity of the four Brothers was
the fact that Bixton was among the number
to be transferred. Fate had evidently
elected that Bixton should not suffer for his
villainy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Corporal Jimmy was divided between pride
in the coming detail and discouragement of the
defeat of their crusade of Justice.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be all puffed up with pleasure over this
trip if it weren&#8217;t for this business about poor
Schnitz,&#8221; he confided to his bunkies on the Friday
night before the start.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never thought I&#8217;d hate to see the last of
Bixton,&#8221; grumbled Bob, &#8220;but I certainly do.
It puts a crimp in the Slippery Sleuths&#8217; Society,
all right, all right. Anyhow, Eldridge is left.
We may be able to tree him. Keep your eye on
Bixton, Blazes, all the way down. You might
just happen to stumble upon something.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would by Jimmy go, the care to him take,&#8221;
broke in Ignace. Up to this point, he had
watched his favorite Brother&#8217;s preparing for
sleep in round-eyed, gloomy silence. &#8220;You take
the good care yoursel&#8217;, Jimmy,&#8221; he anxiously
enjoined. &#8220;You get the hurt never I smile
more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never smile anyway, you old sobersides.&#8221;
Jimmy flashed him an amused, but affectionate
glance. &#8220;Don&#8217;t you worry about me,
Iggy, &#8217;cause I&#8217;ll come back safe and sound. I&#8217;m
not going across. I&#8217;ll only be gone four days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll sure miss you,&#8221; declared Bob. &#8220;Now
I move that we turn in, too, and let Blazes alone.
He has a hard trip ahead of him, and he needs
a long night&#8217;s rest. You&#8217;ll be up first in the
morning, old man. If we&#8217;re asleep, waken us
so we can say good-bye and good luck.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>Bob and Roger were awake as soon as Jimmy.
Ignace, however, slept peacefully on until
Jimmy roused him to say a hasty good-bye.
Three pairs of affectionate eyes watched Corporal
Jimmy to the stairway, their owners sincerely
glad that they had the assurance of his
return. There was but one Jimmy Blaise.</p>

<p>Marched to the station under the graying light
of a cloudy dawn, the majority of the departing
soldier boys were in good spirits. The detachment
numbered a little over three hundred men,
including a sergeant and two other corporals
besides Jimmy, who would return to Camp Sterling
with him once their detail had been accomplished.
Brimming with the adventurous spirit
of youth, the travelers were, for the most part,
exultant to be at last on the way &#8220;to the front.&#8221;</p>

<p>Yet in the breast of one of the gallant little
company, mingled fear and resentment raged.
Bixton was taking the removal very badly,
though no one save himself and Eldridge knew
it. On the previous night he had unburdened
himself to his bunkie in a bitter denunciation
against the Service.</p>

<p>&#8220;Once they get you in the Army, they use you
like a dog,&#8221; he had savagely asserted. &#8220;Expect
you to crawl to every smarty that wears
chevrons, treat you as if you were dirt, and
then think you ought to run all the way to
France to get croaked. It would serve this
country right if it lost out in this war. I was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
a fool to enlist. I could have side-stepped the
draft. A lot of fellows have. Don&#8217;t see why
I should make a target of myself for a government
that don&#8217;t care a hoot about me. I don&#8217;t
want to die. I want to live.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now started on his way toward the thing he
most dreaded, Bixton had determined to take
the bit in his teeth and bolt. From the time he
entered the train he busied himself with concocting
schemes for a successful get-away.</p>

<p>As the day wore on toward evening, Bixton
grew desperate. He had managed on entering
the train to place himself in a seat near the rear
end of the last car. Only a few feet from the
rear platform, it seemed impossible to win it
without being observed. To add to his difficulties,
Jimmy Blaise was also in the same car as
himself. To be sure, he made frequent trips
to and through the two cars ahead, specially
reserved for the detachment. Still, he appeared
to be spending most of his time in the last one.
Bixton regarded this merely as a &#8220;happen-so.&#8221;</p>

<p>Following Christmas, the weather had moderated.
A thaw had set in on the Wednesday
afterward that had rapidly turned the recent
snowfall to slush. Two days of brilliant sunshine
had left the ground fairly bare of white.
Dawn that morning had hinted of rain before
evening. Bixton fervently hoped that it would
rain. Given an early twilight, and a pitch-black
night, he could make good use of it.</p>

<p>By nine o&#8217;clock that evening the rain had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
come&mdash;a slow, dispiriting mist, reinforced later
by a heavy fog. It was an ideal night for a
deserter. Hunched in his seat, Bixton feigned
a drowsiness he was far from feeling. From
under his half-closed lids his pale blue eyes divided
their vigil between his companions and
the foggy world glimpsed through the car windows.
As time dragged on the low hum of
voices around him began to die out. One after
another grew sleepy and dozed off. By ten
o&#8217;clock comparative silence reigned. Occasionally
a soldier roused himself with a jerk to
make a trip to the water cooler directly behind
Bixton.</p>

<p>At five minutes to eleven o&#8217;clock, Jimmy
Blaise walked through the car, and dropped
rather wearily into a vacant seat on the opposite
side from Bixton, but a little ahead. Jimmy was
beginning to feel the strain of the long day&#8217;s
responsibility. Still wide awake, he felt very
tired, but well content. Everything was moving
along smoothly. Half the trip had been made,
and all was well. Not a man had yet attempted
to desert. He doubted if anyone would. Even
Bixton had behaved like a lamb. Small chance
now of doing anything for Schnitz. With this
thought Jimmy&#8217;s contentment vanished in a
rise of bitter reflection against the injustice of
Fate. Poor Schnitz! How terribly he had been
already misjudged! And the worst was yet to
come! With a deep sigh, Jimmy closed his eyes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
and leaned back in the seat, sick at heart.</p>

<p>For perhaps ten minutes he remained thus,
eyes closed, but otherwise keenly aware of his
surroundings. Due to increasing fog, the train
was running more slowly over a flat stretch of
country, the roadbed of which was almost level
with the rails. Alert to catch every sound, the
monotonous hum of the train itself, as it sped
along through the night, had a slightly blurring
effect on his acute hearing powers&mdash;not great
enough, however, to prevent him from distinguishing
above it a faint click from behind him.
It brought him instantly to an erect sitting posture,
his head turned in the direction whence it
had come.</p>

<p>There came a muffled cry, a flash of olive-drab
down the aisle, the reverberating slam of a
door; then silence. At intervals throughout the
car, drowsy heads bobbed up, the glances of
their owners sleepily directed toward the rear
door. Several of their comrades nearer to the
door than themselves were up, and making for
it. Undoubtedly, something unusual had happened.
But what? They could not then know
that already some distance behind them, two
soldiers, mud-plastered, and shaken by their
mad leap in the dark, were, nevertheless, engaged
in the fight of their lives. A battle in
which Honor strove against Dishonor; a conflict
between Loyalty and Disloyalty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER XXI<br />

<small>THE FIGHT</small></h2>


<p>Shut in on all sides by the fog, ankle deep
in the mud, Corporal Jimmy Blaise and
Private Bixton were locked in a savage
grip, from which one of them fought desperately
to free himself. Bixton had no will to
fight&mdash;he wanted to run. Once clear of his
hated antagonist, he could dash off into the
blackness, and defy pursuit. Only one man
stood between him and liberty. He had risked
too much already to endure defeat and capture.
He <em>must</em> break away.</p>

<p>Jimmy was as fully determined in an opposite
direction. Reckless disregard for himself
had caused him to act with his usual impetuosity.
He had reached the door just in time to
see Bixton about to swing off the train. In the
next instant he had followed his quarry. Luckily
for him, the force of Bixton&#8217;s descent had
sent him sprawling in the mud, for an instant
stunned. Had the train been going at full speed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
he must undoubtedly have been killed. Jimmy,
on the contrary, had landed on his feet like a
cat. Turning instantly, he ran back to where
Bixton was just picking himself up.</p>

<p>With a hoarse shout of triumph, Jimmy
leaped upon Bixton and slammed him back to
earth. Simultaneously with the onslaught, Bixton&#8217;s
brain began to act. His long, wiry arms
flung about Jimmy, he put his full strength into
use. Over and over in the mud they rolled,
neither able to gain the advantage.</p>

<p>It was a sickening struggle, calculated to wear
out both combatants in short order. The collapse
of one meant the supremacy of the other.
Evenly matched in sheer brute strength, it soon
became a test of which could endure longest.</p>

<p>Forced by the growing knowledge that he was
beginning to weaken, Jimmy came into a last
fierce rush of strength that tore him free of that
devastating hold. Before Bixton could rise,
Jimmy was upon him like a whirlwind, striking
ferociously in the dark. His first blow landed
full on the deserter&#8217;s chest, eliciting from him a
deep groan. It was followed by a rain of blows
planted with all the strength that Jimmy had
left in him. Nor did his arm cease to descend
until it began to dawn upon him that he was
having things all his own way. He had won;
knocked out Bixton. Perhaps he had killed the
man. He hoped not. If he had&mdash;&mdash; Jimmy
slid off his foe&#8217;s motionless body, and groped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
in his trousers&#8217; pocket for his flashlight. It
had no doubt been wrecked, he thought. He
found it, fumbled it over in the dark. A white
light sprang into being. Turning it directly
on Bixton, Jimmy proceeded to make investigation.</p>

<p>He finally raised up with a relieved sigh.
Bixton was breathing. Now came the question
of what to do next. Bixton would have to be
put past the power of doing further fighting
that night. Perhaps he was, already. Jimmy
intended to take no chances as to that. Bixton
must be tied. But with what? Hastily rising,
Jimmy went through his pockets, producing two
handkerchiefs. Studying for a moment, he bent
down and turned Bixton over. With one handkerchief
he bound the man&#8217;s hands tightly
behind his back, with a secureness that was warranted
to hold. This finally done, he again
paused to consider.</p>

<p>His money belt next went to decorate Bixton.
Of soft, pliable leather, he managed with some
difficulty to tie it about Bixton&#8217;s neck, allowing
sufficient laxity for breathing, but that was all.
Tearing the other handkerchief diagonally
across, he knotted it together, twisted it into a
rope, and knotted one end of it around the belt.
Now he had a halter by which he purposed to
lead Bixton, provided he was able to walk. It
would not be a pleasant business, but it was the
only way. All he could now do was to await the
awakening of his captive.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>That awakening took place about ten minutes
after Jimmy had concluded his preparations.
It began with moans, was succeeded by indistinct
mutterings, and ended in a volley of curses,
as Bixton endeavored to sit up, only to find that
something peculiar had happened to his arms.
Promptly getting behind him, Jimmy helped him
to his feet, not forgetting to obtain a good grip
on the improvised halter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Now listen to me, you deserter,&#8221; he began
sternly, still behind his man. &#8220;I&#8217;ve got you
where I want you. You can&#8217;t get away from
me. If you try to you&#8217;ll only succeed in shutting
off your own wind. So don&#8217;t start anything.
I&#8217;ve put your arms out of business, too.
You&#8217;ve still got a pair of legs, though, and
you&#8217;re going to use &#8217;em. We&#8217;re going to start
now for somewhere. You&#8217;ll be ahead and I&#8217;ll
be about two feet behind you, treading on your
heels. We&#8217;ll follow the railroad track until we
get to some place where I can hand you over as
a deserter. But before we start you&#8217;re going
to tell me a few things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bixton&#8217;s only reply was a series of violent
jerks that soon ceased. Half-strangled by his
efforts, and still groggy from his recent punishment,
he soon ceased struggling, and stood still.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221; Jimmy&#8217;s voice quivered with
irony. &#8220;Now I guess we&#8217;re ready for our talk.
First, where did you get that list of poisons,
and that bottle of powdered glass that you put<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
in Schnitzel&#8217;s suitcase? I know you stole our
letters, and put &#8217;em with the other stuff.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lie. You do know. Answer me with
the truth.&#8221; Jimmy jerked the halter.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop that! Do you want to kill me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t die. Don&#8217;t worry about that.
Now tell me quick, or I&#8217;ll repeat my little halter
stunt.&#8221; Realizing that he had a coward, as well
as a villain to deal with, Jimmy pretended a
cold-bloodedness which he did not feel. He had
no desire to do Bixton personal injury. He was
merely set on wringing a confession from him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything about a poison list,&#8221;
quavered Bixton. &#8220;I pounded up the glass myself,
and put it in that Fritzie&#8217;s suitcase for a
joke. I took your letters to get even with you.
I kept &#8217;em till I got a chance to stick &#8217;em onto
Schnitz when they&#8217;d raise a fuss.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a pretty streaked joke that will put a
man in prison on a murder charge. Anyway,
you&#8217;ve admitted it. You&#8217;ll do it again as
soon as we get to where you can make a full
confession and sign it. After that you can answer
to a charge for deserting from the Service.
Now, Forward March, and remember
I&#8217;m right with you. The track&#8217;s straight
ahead.&#8221;</p>

<p>It is difficult for one man, wholly unimpeded,
to travel sure-footedly in the darkness. A journey
such as Jimmy made that night, in company
with Bixton, he regarded ever afterward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
as the supreme feat of his military career. The
night wore on, and the fog lifted, but still that
strangely assorted pair tramped the ties, stepping
off twice to let trains go by them, which
Jimmy vainly hailed. Toward five o&#8217;clock the
myriad lights of a large town began to gleam
ahead of them. Traveling with such painful
slowness, Jimmy had no idea of how far they
had walked. Neither did he care. All he wanted
was to reach some place where he could rid himself
of his detested captive.</p>

<p>It was half-past five when they entered the
railroad yards of the town. Dawn just beginning
to show in the east, their first encounter
was with a railroad policeman who stood transfixed
in the middle of a yawn at sight of
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hello, there!&#8221; hailed Jimmy. &#8220;I need you.
This fellow is a deserter. He was on the way
to Camp Abbott and jumped the train. I
jumped after him and nailed him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a lie,&#8221; shrieked Bixton. &#8220;He&#8217;s the deserter.
It&#8217;s the other way round. He deserted
and I jumped off after him. We had a fight
and he nailed me. I&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Corporal Blaise from Camp Sterling.&#8221;
Jimmy pointed to the insignia on his sleeve.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span> &#8220;I
was sent to help conduct a detachment of men
to Camp Abbott. What I want to do is to turn
this man over to you, so that I can telegraph
my K. O. After that he has a confession to
make that I want taken down before proper
authorities and signed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty smart Sammy.&#8221; The policeman
viewed Jimmy with admiration. &#8220;Now
you just let me handle this. I&#8217;ll run this yellow
dog in while you go and get cleaned up and do
your telegraphing. You&#8217;d better take time to
eat a bite, too. Afterward you take a hike up
to Station House No. 10. It&#8217;s about three
blocks from here. You can find it. That&#8217;s
where this un&#8217;s going on the jump. Some harness
you put on him! Guess you give him a
mud bath and took one yourself. You&#8217;re a good
&#8217;un, blessed if you ain&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m not so much.&#8221; Jimmy grinned, his
face flushing under its liberal coating of mud.
&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m going to beat it. So long.&#8221;</p>

<p>Heading on a run for the nearby railroad station,
Jimmy felt in a pocket and fished up the
little wad of notes he had extracted from his
money belt before decorating Bixton with it.
Entering the station telegraph office, he sent
his message.</p>

<p>&#8220;Guess that&#8217;ll give &#8217;em a surprise at headquarters,&#8221;
he reflected as he left the telegraph
office. &#8220;It&#8217;s been some night and it&#8217;s going to
be some day. A fine, peaceful, quiet Sunday at
that. I&#8217;ll have to stay here, I guess, until I&#8217;m
told what to do next. But, oh, boy! Wait till
I get back to Sterling!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<small>THE ROUND-UP</small></h2>


<p>Meanwhile at Camp Sterling, Saturday
and Sunday passed uneventfully
for Jimmy&#8217;s bunkies. Following Retreat
on Monday afternoon Bob was called to
the company post-office to sign for and receive a
special delivery letter. He rushed back to barracks
in a state of jubilant excitement. Calling
Iggy and Roger to him, he read it to them just
above a whisper. It was from his newspaper
friend in Chicago. He had gone out to look up
Eldridge on the same day he had received the
letter. It had been no trouble to gather information
concerning the man. He had gone
straight to the given address, and inquired for
Eldridge, pretending to be an old acquaintance
who had lost track of him. He had been received
by the man&#8217;s sister and by adroit questioning
he had learned much. Eldridge, it
seemed, had been a prescription clerk in a drug
store until shortly before his enlistment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Obtaining the name of the druggist from the
sister, he had later that day visited the store
and learned that Eldridge had been discharged
by his employer for reasons which the druggist
declined to state. He characterized Eldridge as
a sneak and unreliable. The writer of the letter
ended by saying that he hoped the data would
be of use to Bob in helping to clear Schnitzel.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve found out now the thing I wanted to
know most. It&#8217;s a safe bet that Eldridge furnished
the poison list. A prescription clerk
would of course understand a lot about poisons
and their effects. He&#8217;d be pretty sure to know
typing, too. Most medicine labels are typed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall you do about it?&#8221; asked Roger.
&#8220;Put it up to Eldridge he&#8217;ll just deny it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan&#8217;t stop at him. I&#8217;m going to the K. O.
after mess to-night. What I&#8217;ve discovered isn&#8217;t
much but it may help some. <em>He&#8217;ll</em> send for
Eldridge and maybe get out of him what I
couldn&#8217;t. I&#8217;m going out now to get a paper
before every last one of &#8217;em is gobbled up.&#8221;</p>

<p>So saying, Bob tucked his letter into his
pocket, grabbed his hat and hurried off to the
canteen. Stopping to glance at the newspaper
he had just purchased, he vented a wild whoop,
waved it over his head and raced for barracks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Glory! Blazes has done it!&#8221; he caroled,
regardless of the noise he was making.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span> &#8220;Just
listen to this: &#8216;Corporal Blaise Leaps Off a
Moving Train after Deserter.&#8217; <em>What</em> do you
think of that? Oh, you Blazes!&#8221; Bob pranced
about, flapping the paper.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the latest?&#8221; called a man from
across the squad room. &#8220;Has Bill committed
suicide?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet. Come over and bring your
friends. This is too good to keep.&#8221;</p>

<p>Two minutes afterward, surrounded by curious
soldiers, Bob read to them the story of Bixton&#8217;s
attempt to desert, and of the star part
Jimmy had played in his capture. What elicited
a fresh volley of astonished ejaculations
from the listeners, however, was: &#8220;Bixton has
also confessed to the placing of a bottle of powdered
glass in the suitcase of Private Franz
Schnitzel, the Camp Sterling alleged poisoner,
who is now awaiting trial for the murder of two
of his comrades. Schnitzel was on kitchen detail
when the tragedy occurred. The bottle of
powdered glass and a list of poisons found in
his suitcase linked him so suspiciously with the
poisoning as to cause his arrest. Bixton confessed
to having done this to be revenged on
Schnitzel for past wrongs at the hands of the
latter. He denied, however, all knowledge of
the list of poisons.&#8221;</p>

<p>Call to mess cut the rest of the reading short.</p>

<p>Leaving his precious paper and mess kit with
Roger, Bob set sail for headquarters the moment
he had finished eating. There he was
obliged to wait some time as Major Stearns,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
being only human, was at dinner, a fact which
Bob had not stopped to consider. Eventually
he was ushered into the presence of the K. O.
and proceeded to regale the major with a story
that continually brought the K. O.&#8217;s favorite
&#8220;Humph!&#8221; to his lips. When he had finished
he went back to barracks well pleased, leaving
the letter from his Chicago friend in the major&#8217;s
possession.</p>

<p>Surprise, however, had not run the gamut
for that night. Shortly before Tattoo a guard
detail marched into Company E squad room and
arrested Eldridge. The latter was undoubtedly
more surprised than anyone else. In reading
the account of his bunkie&#8217;s downfall he had been
signally relieved to find that he had not been
implicated in the suitcase tangle. He was confident
that Bixton would never betray him and
thus believed himself quite safe.</p>

<p>What greatly interested the three Khaki Boys
was how soon Schnitzel would be freed. They
were fairly sure that Eldridge would not stand
out long against the grilling he was due to receive.
Add his confession to Bixton&#8217;s and it
left no more evidence against Schnitzel than
there had been against the rest of the kitchen
detail held at the time of the poisoning and
afterward exonerated of all suspicion. It was,
as Bob joyfully declared, &#8220;a safe bet&#8221; that
&#8220;Schnitz&#8221; would soon be back in barracks with
&#8220;a smiling face and a clean record.&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII<br />

<small>IGGY TURNS SLEUTH</small></h2>


<p>Vindicated at the eleventh hour by the
confessions of Bixton and Eldridge,
Franz Schnitzel returned to barracks
completely exonerated of the crime of poisoning
his comrades. Bixton and Eldridge both
underwent speedy trial by a court martial.
Bixton was charged with desertion and conspiracy,
and sentenced to several years in a
Federal prison, while Eldridge escaped with a
year. As an accomplice of Bixton in the matter
of the suitcase affair, he was deemed equally
guilty of conspiracy.</p>

<p>During the first week or two after his return
to his company, Schnitzel showed a depth of
gratitude toward the four Brothers that only
one who had been so long in the shadow could
exhibit to those who had led him back into the
sunshine. As time went on, however, he relapsed
into his old taciturn ways. He took to
prowling about by himself seeming almost to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
resent the Khaki Boys&#8217; kindly invitations to accompany
them on their little adventures about
camp or to Tremont or Glenwood.</p>

<p>In fact Schnitzel showed a decided predilection
for the society of a Cuban, named Fernando,
who lived in Company E&#8217;s adjoining
barrack. Fernando was a man who had almost
as little to say as had Schnitzel. Though not a
citizen of the United States he had enlisted
shortly before the four Khaki Boys had come
to Camp Sterling. At the time of the poisoning
he had been on kitchen detail also and, soon
after Schnitzel&#8217;s release, the German-American
had struck up a friendship with him.</p>

<p>&#8220;I no like him, that Koobain,&#8221; Ignace frequently
protested to his bunkies. &#8220;Never I see
why Schnitzel go by him all time. He no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>Growing distrust of Fernando prompted Iggy
to poke about in the discreet wake of Schnitzel
and the Cuban. His frequent absences from
barracks in the evening occasioned a good deal
of curious comment on the part of his bunkies.</p>

<p>One night as they discussed this Iggy was
hiking along through a fine rain after his
quarry. He had followed Schnitzel out of barracks
and seen him meet Fernando. This evening
the two had elected to walk far despite the
bad weather. Coming at last to an outlying
barrack in an early stage of the process of
erection, the two paused before it and began to
talk. Seeing them stop, Iggy stopped also at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
a safe distance. He dared go no nearer to them.
Deeply disappointed, he was about to turn back
when a brilliant idea assailed him.</p>

<p>Keeping well in the shelter of a neighboring
barrack which was almost completed, he made a
wide circle and approached the skeleton of the
other barrack from the back. It would be easy
enough for him to climb into it and make his
way to the partially open front, provided he
could do it without being heard. Once there he
could crouch low within a few feet of the two
men and perhaps overhear what they said. He
had already heard at different times enough of
their talk to worry him. Now he proposed to
hear still more&mdash;if only they did not go away
before he got to them. The first words he
heard, spoken in German, nearly toppled him
over.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are willing to do this for the Fatherland?&#8221;
It was the supposed Cuban who spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. I long to be of use to Germany. Nothing
else can wipe out the trouble that these
cursed Americans have made me. I wish now
that I had been the one to poison those dogs.
Then I would have gloried in it.&#8221;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;You have been spared for a greater work.
What you will do to-morrow night will well
recompense you. Now remember. Meet me
here at six to-morrow evening. I will give you
the camera. Be sure and set it in the rubbish
can with the tripod socket downward. The
shutter release is on the side. You will have
fastened one end of this piece of fishing line to
the trigger of the shutter release. Fishing line
does not stretch. Loop the other end round one
of the bolts on the inside of the cover that hold
its handle on. I have examined those covers
and there is a bolt end coming through which
makes this possible. Tie it with as little slack
as possible and fit the cover on the can. The
first man who lifts it will do the trick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will happen when that release is
pulled?&#8221; asked Schnitzel.</p>

<p>The other man chuckled grimly.</p>

<p>&#8220;A snap shot will be taken somewhat different
from the usual sort. That release controls
an electrical contact intimately connected with a
certain kind of fulminate and behind that again
is&mdash;the stuff that means the finish of Company
E barracks. The explosion will be so destructive
that no trace will be left of either the camera
or the can. Very soon afterward Company
E&#8217;s other barrack will follow yours. This is a
trick which can be successfully worked twice.
Now heed what I tell you, as this is our only
chance to talk. To-morrow night I will meet
you here only for a moment to give you the
camera. You must then hurry back and do your
work, while the men are at mess. We can only
trust that no one will disturb the can too soon.
We must destroy as many of our enemies as we
can before they are sent out against us. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
are not afraid to do your part for the Fatherland?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Deutschland über alles</em>,&#8221; was Schnitzel&#8217;s
low, fervent answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Gut!</em> Now we must return. Go you first
and I will follow slowly. I shall not see you
again until I meet you here at six to-morrow
evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>Trembling with horror at what he had heard,
Ignace waited breathlessly for the plotters to
depart. After five minutes he straightened up
cautiously. All was silent. Growing bolder he
stood erect and peered out of one of the open
spaces in the frame-work of the barrack. No
one was in sight. Making a hasty exit he set
off for headquarters on the mad run.</p>

<p>Arrived at headquarters he had his own troubles
with a supercilious orderly, who demanded
to know the nature of his business.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will no tell,&#8221; was the Pole&#8217;s dogged refusal.
&#8220;You no say him Pulinski want see, you
ver&#8217; sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>This threat was effective in gaining for him
the desired interview. His tale told, Ignace became
alarmed at the major&#8217;s lack of agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;You no believe, sir, what I do?&#8221; he ended
desperately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, Pulinski.&#8221; The K. O.&#8217;s tone
was extremely kind. &#8220;Now I&#8217;m going to ask
you to go back to barracks and say nothing to
anyone about this. You&#8217;ve done your part and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
done it well. Leave the rest to me, and remember
the Army will protect its own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So will I, sir. For Schnitzel have I the hurt
here.&#8221; Iggy laid a hand on his heart. &#8220;Never
have I think he spy. Once fren&#8217;s. Now him
enemy my country, my enemy, too. I am the
solder.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saluting, Iggy departed wholly unconscious
of the nobility of his little speech.</p>

<p>The next day broke in a torrent of rain that
gradually slackened to a fine mist that continued
to fall all day, bringing on an early dusk.
Painfully on the alert, Ignace had watched
vainly all day for the &#8220;som&#8217;thin&#8217;.&#8221; He had
had no trouble in avoiding Schnitzel. The latter
had not come near the four Brothers. When
at ten minutes to six Ignace saw him go down
the squad-room stairs, he was in a fever of
dread. The time had come and the &#8220;so cross
major&#8221; had done nothing. He had not believed,
then, after all. Ignace decided that he would
have to take the initiative. He would say he
was not hungry. He would not go to mess. He
would stay in barracks and watch the rubbish
can. If Schnitzel attempted to go near it, he
would fight him away from it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Schnitzel was forging along
through the mist toward the rendezvous. As
he neared the spot, he could see no one. Drawing
close to the barrack he waited, eyes and
ears trained to catch first sight and sound of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
Fernando. It was only a moment or two until
he heard the swashing contact of running feet
with mud. Next a rain-drenched figure made
port beside him, flashing a white ray of light
upon him.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is you,&#8221; spoke a relieved voice in German.
&#8220;Here is the camera. Take it quickly.
I must return. Fail you not. Strike well for
the Fatherland!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hold it just a second,&#8221; replied Schnitzel.
&#8220;I brought a paper for it to guard against the
rain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<em>Gut</em>,&#8221; approved the voice. &#8220;<em>Bitte, schnell!</em>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All&#8217;s well!&#8221; Schnitzel exclaimed loudly in
English.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shh! Are you mad that you&mdash;&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>The question was never answered. Forth
from the skeleton of the barrack leaped a succession
of dark forms. They closed in on the
pair with incredible quickness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Traitor!&#8221; came a savage cry uttered in
German. &#8220;Die then, with your kind!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet,&#8221; panted Schnitzel as the supposed
colleagues fought desperately for the possession
of the camera case, to which Schnitzel clung
like grim death. &#8220;Got it,&#8221; he bellowed. &#8220;Hold
him tight! He&#8217;s Freidrich, not Fernando!
He&#8217;s a German spy! He poisoned the boys!
He tried to blow up the barracks! I swore to
run him down! I&#8217;ve done it. Let him die like
a dog! Shooting&#8217;s too good for him!&#8221;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<small>CONCLUSION</small></h2>


<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re here because we&#8217;re here!&#8221;
announced Bob, beaming fatuously
on four young men gathered about
a round table in a Tremont restaurant.</p>

<p>A week had elapsed since Franz Schnitzel had
sprung the dramatic dénouement that had rid
the world of one more fiend. Johann Freidrich,
alias Juan Fernando, had been shot at sunrise
of the morning before. Bob whimsically declaring
that the event needed celebrating, he had
straightway invited his Brothers and Schnitzel
to a celebration in Tremont.</p>

<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re not going to be <em>here</em> long. I mean at
Camp Sterling,&#8221; smiled Roger. &#8220;I expect any
minute to get the order to pack.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should worry,&#8221; rejoined Bob. &#8220;We&#8217;ve
stirring times ahead of us. We&#8217;ve had a few
right in camp, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gee whiz, Schnitz, you must feel great!&#8221;
glowed Jimmy. &#8220;Think of all you&#8217;ve done al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>ready
for your country. I thought I was some
when I nabbed Bixton. Beside you&mdash;well&mdash;I&#8217;m
not so much. What a shame there aren&#8217;t any
medals handed out in the Army. You ought to
get enough to cover up your chest. You&#8217;re due
for a rise in ranks, though. Bet you my hat on
that. Now you&#8217;ve got to tell us how you did it
all. You&#8217;ve never peeped. We&#8217;ve been laying
for you. Got you down here on purpose to-night.
Now spill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I intended to tell you fellows.&#8221; Schnitzel&#8217;s
melancholy dark eyes wandered over the group.
Ever since that eventful evening in the rain he
had been the observed of all observers. As a
result he had promptly retired into his shell,
declining to be lionized. Even to the four Khaki
Boys he had granted only the barest details of
his exploit.</p>

<p>&#8220;Somehow I couldn&#8217;t bear to talk about it.
It was all so sickening. But I don&#8217;t mind telling
you fellows now. There isn&#8217;t much to tell.
I never suspected Freidrich until after I got
out of the guard-house. One day he came to me
and started saying how sorry he&#8217;d been for me.
He began asking me about myself and my people.
What they thought about the war and if
they had any relatives in it in Germany. He
said many of the Germans were fine people
who&#8217;d been misunderstood. He gave me a kind
of a queer look and, I don&#8217;t know why, but it
somehow made me distrust him. So I said I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
didn&#8217;t know how my folks felt about it because
I hadn&#8217;t seen them for several years. That
wasn&#8217;t true, but anyway it wasn&#8217;t any of his
business. I told him I didn&#8217;t know if any of
our relatives in Germany were in the war. That
was true enough. I didn&#8217;t say what I thought
about the Germans themselves.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was all he said that time. He kept
coming around after me and sympathizing with
me. I thought at first he was trying to get me
to queer myself. Thought maybe headquarters
had put him on my trail to see if I was really
all O. K. So I was pretty careful. I found out
he could speak German, too. I thought that was
rather queer and said so. He explained that
he&#8217;d learned it from a German overseer on his
father&#8217;s plantation in Cuba. I didn&#8217;t believe it.
He spoke it like a German. He had more of
the way of a German than a Cuban.</p>

<p>&#8220;All of a sudden I made up my mind not to
go on in the dark. I went to the K. O. and
asked him flat if Fernando had been set to watch
me. He nearly had a fit until I told him a few
things that I suspected. Then he gave me leave
to spring a bluff on the fellow that I was down
on the Army, just to see what he&#8217;d do.</p>

<p>&#8220;So next day I went to him and gave him a
great line of talk about how sick I was of Camp
Sterling and what a mistake the U. S. had made
in declaring war on the Fatherland. That made
him prick up his ears. But he was no fool. I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
had to string him along good and hard before
he bit at the hook. One day he asked me why
I&#8217;d enlisted. I just smiled and threw him a
funny look. He stared hard at me and muttered:
&#8216;Hoch der Kaiser,&#8217; and I said: &#8216;You bet.&#8217;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I had him going. After that it was
easy. He soon got so he&#8217;d talk for hours about
how bad the Germans had been treated. He&#8217;d
almost always end by saying, &#8216;It is for you and
me to avenge the great wrongs done the Fatherland.&#8217;
But he&#8217;d never said what we ought to do
until about a week before the bomb business.
Then he asked me to go for a walk. We went
away out past the trenches. After a while he
stopped me and asked if I was willing to do my
bit for the Kaiser. I said I was and he put me
through an oath of allegiance to Kaiser Bill
and then told me what the &#8216;great work&#8217; was
to be. He was careful not to let me know how
he got the bombs. He had two or three of them,
you know.</p>

<p>&#8220;I put it up strong to him then about the
poison. Gave him a lot of guff about our being
Brothers in the cause, and all that. He didn&#8217;t
say in so many words that he did it, but he let
me understand it just the same. You know the
rest. Thank God, I got that bomb away from
him. I&#8217;m glad I could do something to help the
United States and I&#8217;m glad, too, on my own
account. I&#8217;d never have rested easy as long as
that poison affair wasn&#8217;t cleared up. I feel now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
as though I couldn&#8217;t go over quick enough to
help even the score for Simpson and Brady.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way we all feel,&#8221; declared
Jimmy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would to-morrow go,&#8221; declared Ignace.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m ready to hike along the little old
Glory Road,&#8221; smiled Roger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here, too,&#8221; echoed Bob.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s us,&#8221; approved Bob. &#8220;Lead us to
it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Going Over&#8221; held no dread for the Khaki
Boys. They were indeed ready to take their
chance beneath the Stars and Stripes in the
trenches of far-off France.</p>

happened to them after leaving Camp Sterling
